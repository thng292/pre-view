Job Description: Work with a development team on a custom development project to enhance our provider data within the Cognizant Facets system. SHP receives rosters from provider groups with changes and new providers. The files for the most part are different from each other.

There is a front end UI that supports the roster load automation and provides a way to configure the different rosters, and provide feedback for the load. There will be a need for the person to be able to assist with the front end UI development. During the development process, the developer would be expected to perform code reviews and developer testing. Post development, we use Azure DevOps to automate our build and promotion processes. There will be a need to assist in maintaining the build processes. This is done in a C# .NET and SQL Server environment that is hosted in Azure.

 EXPERIENCE/EDUCATION/QUALIFICATIONS Bachelor’s degree (preferably in a related field) or equivalent experience required. Five (5) years information technology and development experience required. Advanced level experience with programming language(s) required. Industry recognized, current and relevant certification preferred. Experience in a healthcare environment preferred.

Please note applications without portfolio / sample work will not be reviewed!
Type/Code recognizes that diverse teams make the strongest teams. Candidates from traditionally underrepresented groups in tech are highly encouraged to apply.
At 15 people, our team is lean, and our developers are top notch. As a frontend developer at Type/Code, you won’t just be churning out code at breakneck speed, blindly following a spec, disconnected from your work. You’ll care about the products you build and the community you build it with. You’ll exercise autonomy and decision-making alongside team collaboration and mentorship to do amazing work. We hold ourselves to a high level of visual finesse and are always exploring novel approaches to layouts and interactivity.
Our bespoke interface designs are very non-traditional/non-uniform and require both creativity and a thorough understanding of visual design fundamentals for implementing refined typography, complex layouts, and elevating static designs and prototypes with thoughtful interaction details, transitions, and animations — coupled with a thorough understanding of UX fundamentals to ensure functional and behavioral usability.
Every dev on our team came on board with different strengths and we’re not too prescriptive about your current specific expertise. At Type/Code you’ll be expected to constantly learn and grow on the job, taking on interesting tasks outside your normal wheelhouse and expanding your toolkit. That said, this is a mid to senior role and significant experience (3-5+ years) as an frontend developer is a must. While familiarity with modern javascript frameworks (and related tools) is required, our biggest need right now is for a real styling genius. Extensive (and demonstrable) experience with thoughtfully implemented Sass/CSS is a must - send us samples!
What We Value:Community: our team is small and close knit and we want you to join the familyWork/life balance: we're not a startup, we tend to stay away from projects with difficult deadlines (not to say it doesn't happen), and we want you to be happy so you should make your non-work life a priority!Thoughtful, high quality work: we want you to own what you do, care about it, want to do it well, and create something you feel good aboutCommunication: especially in the current distributed model, frequent and clear communication with the team is crucial
As a mid to senior level position, experience with all of the below is preferred and expertise in some is assumed. As such, in your cover letter/email we’d love to hear about your experience with the following:
In order of importance(1) Frontend styling: we strongly favor greenfield/project-specific Sass rather than using a CSS framework and always emphasize responsive implementations. As mentioned above, our bespoke layouts and designs are very non-traditional/non-uniform and require both creativity and a thorough understanding of complex styling.
(2) Frontend javascript development: we're primarily a Vue.js shop, though we do have some React projects (and this may increase in the near future), with an equal emphasis on presentation and actual application logic. Our complex frontend applications require thorough knowledge of vanilla JS and the DOM.
(3) Backend integration: we work with both REST and GraphQL APIs
(4) Development lifecycle: we're not super rigid here, but we follow a formal dev/stage/deploy process with extensive code review and QA, TDD when it makes sense, and as agile as makes sense for a particular project’s requirements
(5) Version control: GitHub and increasingly all the fancy GitHub features (issues, discussions, actions, secrets, etc)
Though our team is currently pretty distributed we've recently opened a Brooklyn office and local employees are encouraged to come in a couple times a week (though not explicitly required) — our only location requirement is that you have sufficient work hours overlap with the rest of the team.
Compensation & Benefits:Competitive salaryUp to 100% coverage on health, dental, and vision insurance401k MatchingGenerous vacation policy; unlimited sick daysUp to 15 holidays including the entire week from Dec 24th to after the New YearProfessional growth stipendFairly location agnosticFlexible hours
