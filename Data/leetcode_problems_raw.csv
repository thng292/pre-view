Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array II,"You are given an array nums consisting of n prime integers.
You need to construct an array ans of length n, such that, for each index i, the bitwise OR of ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 is equal to nums[i], i.e. ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i].
Additionally, you must minimize each value of ans[i] in the resulting array.
If it is not possible to find such a value for ans[i] that satisfies the condition, then set ans[i] = -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]
Output: [-1,1,4,3]
Explanation:

For i = 0, as there is no value for ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 2, so ans[0] = -1.
For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 3 is 1, because 1 OR (1 + 1) = 3.
For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 5 is 4, because 4 OR (4 + 1) = 5.
For i = 3, the smallest ans[3] that satisfies ans[3] OR (ans[3] + 1) = 7 is 3, because 3 OR (3 + 1) = 7.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [11,13,31]
Output: [9,12,15]
Explanation:

For i = 0, the smallest ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 11 is 9, because 9 OR (9 + 1) = 11.
For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 13 is 12, because 12 OR (12 + 1) = 13.
For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 31 is 15, because 15 OR (15 + 1) = 31.

Find X-Sum of All K-Long Subarrays I,"You are given an array nums of n integers and two integers k and x.
The x-sum of an array is calculated by the following procedure:

Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
Keep only the occurrences of the top x most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the bigger value is considered more frequent.
Calculate the sum of the resulting array.

Note that if an array has less than x distinct elements, its x-sum is the sum of the array.
Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2

Explanation:

For subarray [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.
For subarray [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.
For subarray [2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3], only elements 2 and 3 are kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[2] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,8,7,8,7,5], k = 2, x = 2

Maximum Number of Moves to Kill All Pawns,"There is a 50 x 50 chessboard with one knight and some pawns on it. You are given two integers kx and ky where (kx, ky) denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.
Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:

The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves. Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves.
In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them. Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

Alice is trying to maximize the sum of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to minimize them.
Return the maximum total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play optimally.

verticalCut of size n - 1, where verticalCut[j] represents the cost to cut along the vertical line j.

In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a 1 x 1 square and perform one of the following cuts:

Cut along a horizontal line i at a cost of horizontalCut[i].
Cut along a vertical line j at a cost of verticalCut[j].

After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.
The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not change.

Maximize Total Cost of Alternating Subarrays,"You are given an integer array nums with length n.
The cost of a subarray nums[l..r], where 0 <= l <= r < n, is defined as:
cost(l, r) = nums[l] - nums[l + 1] + ... + nums[r] * (−1)r − l
Your task is to split nums into subarrays such that the total cost of the subarrays is maximized, ensuring each element belongs to exactly one subarray.
Formally, if nums is split into k subarrays, where k > 1, at indices i1, i2, ..., ik − 1, where 0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik - 1 < n - 1, then the total cost will be:
cost(0, i1) + cost(i1 + 1, i2) + ... + cost(ik − 1 + 1, n − 1)
Return an integer denoting the maximum total cost of the subarrays after splitting the array optimally.
Note: If nums is not split into subarrays, i.e. k = 1, the total cost is simply cost(0, n - 1).
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,-2,3,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:
One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -2, 3, 4] into subarrays [1, -2, 3] and [4]. The total cost will be (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 = 10.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,-1,1,-1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -1, 1, -1] into subarrays [1, -1] and [1, -1]. The total cost will be (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
We cannot split the array further, so the answer is 0.

Example 4:

Input: nums = [1,-1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Selecting the whole array gives a total cost of 1 + 1 = 2, which is the maximum.

Vowels Game in a String,"Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.
You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:

On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.
On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.

The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.
The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""leetcoder""
Output: true
Explanation:
Alice can win the game as follows:

Alice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in s = ""leetcoder"" which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is s = ""der"".
Bob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in s = ""der"" which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string is s = ""er"".
Alice plays third, she can delete the whole string s = ""er"" which contains 1 vowel.
Bob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.

You are given a 2D array queries, which contains two types of queries:

For a query of type 1, queries[i] = [1, x]. Build an obstacle at distance x from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is no obstacle at distance x when the query is asked.
For a query of type 2, queries[i] = [2, x, sz]. Check if it is possible to place a block of size sz anywhere in the range [0, x] on the line, such that the block entirely lies in the range [0, x]. A block cannot be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do not actually place the block. Queries are separate.

Minimum Levels to Gain More Points,"You are given a binary array possible of length n.
Alice and Bob are playing a game that consists of n levels. Some of the levels in the game are impossible to clear while others can always be cleared. In particular, if possible[i] == 0, then the ith level is impossible to clear for both the players. A player gains 1 point on clearing a level and loses 1 point if the player fails to clear it.
At the start of the game, Alice will play some levels in the given order starting from the 0th level, after which Bob will play for the rest of the levels.
Alice wants to know the minimum number of levels she should play to gain more points than Bob, if both players play optimally to maximize their points.
Return the minimum number of levels Alice should play to gain more points. If this is not possible, return -1.
Note that each player must play at least 1 level.
 
Example 1:

Input: possible = [1,0,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Let's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:

If Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 point.
If Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 = 0 points, while Bob has 1 - 1 = 0 points.
If Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 point, while Bob has -1 point.

Alice must play a minimum of 1 level to gain more points.

Example 2:

Input: possible = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Let's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:

If Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has 4 points.
If Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 2 points, while Bob has 3 points.
If Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 3 points, while Bob has 2 points.
If Alice plays till level 3 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 4 points, while Bob has 1 point.

Alice must play a minimum of 3 levels to gain more points.

Example 3:

We define a function greaterCount such that greaterCount(arr, val) returns the number of elements in arr that are strictly greater than val.
You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:

If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) > greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr1.
If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) < greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr2.
If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) == greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to the array with a lesser number of elements.
If there is still a tie, append nums[i] to arr1.

The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].
In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1.
In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. As the length of arr2 is lesser, hence, append nums[4] to arr2.
After 4 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1,3].

You are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight of wi.
A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.
The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is w0, w1, w2, ..., wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.

Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones,"You are given a binary array nums of length n, a positive integer k and a non-negative integer maxChanges.
Alice plays a game, where the goal is for Alice to pick up k ones from nums using the minimum number of moves. When the game starts, Alice picks up any index aliceIndex in the range [0, n - 1] and stands there. If nums[aliceIndex] == 1 , Alice picks up the one and nums[aliceIndex] becomes 0(this does not count as a move). After this, Alice can make any number of moves (including zero) where in each move Alice must perform exactly one of the following actions:

Select any index j != aliceIndex such that nums[j] == 0 and set nums[j] = 1. This action can be performed at most maxChanges times.
Select any two adjacent indices x and y (|x - y| == 1) such that nums[x] == 1, nums[y] == 0, then swap their values (set nums[y] = 1 and nums[x] = 0). If y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one after this move and nums[y] becomes 0.

Return the minimum number of moves required by Alice to pick exactly k ones.
 
Example 1:

Output: [0,4,6,6,4,0]
Explanation: Since signalSpeed is 1, count[c] is equal to the number of pairs of paths that start at c and do not share any edges.
In the case of the given path graph, count[c] is equal to the number of servers to the left of c multiplied by the servers to the right of c.

Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 1. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.
Example 2:

Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[1,3],[1,5]], topRight = [[5,5],[5,7],[5,9]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
A square with side length 2 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 2 * 2 = 4. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.
Example 3:
  
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[3,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside the intersecting region of any two rectangles. Also, no larger square can, so the maximum area is 1. Note that the region can be formed by the intersection of more than 2 rectangles.

Return the most frequent prime number greater than 10 out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or -1 if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the largest among them.
Note: It is invalid to change the direction during the move.
 
Example 1:
 


Input: mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]
Output: 19
Explanation: 
From cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:
East: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [99,91,91,91,91].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [91,91,99,91,91].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [11,19,191,19].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [11,19,19,191].
The most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 19.
Example 2:

Input: mat = [[7]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The only number which can be formed is 7. It is a prime number however it is not greater than 10, so return -1.
Example 3:

Input: mat = [[9,7,8],[4,6,5],[2,8,6]]
Output: 97

Maximum Strength of K Disjoint Subarrays,"You are given an array of integers nums with length n, and a positive odd integer k.
Select exactly k disjoint subarrays sub1, sub2, ..., subk from nums such that the last element of subi appears before the first element of sub{i+1} for all 1 <= i <= k-1. The goal is to maximize their combined strength.
The strength of the selected subarrays is defined as:
strength = k * sum(sub1)- (k - 1) * sum(sub2) + (k - 2) * sum(sub3) - ... - 2 * sum(sub{k-1}) + sum(subk)
where sum(subi) is the sum of the elements in the i-th subarray.
Return the maximum possible strength that can be obtained from selecting exactly k disjoint subarrays from nums.
Note that the chosen subarrays don't need to cover the entire array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,-1,2], k = 3
Output: 22
Explanation:
The best possible way to select 3 subarrays is: nums[0..2], nums[3..3], and nums[4..4]. The strength is calculated as follows:
strength = 3 * (1 + 2 + 3) - 2 * (-1) + 2 = 22
 
Example 2:
Input: nums = [12,-2,-2,-2,-2], k = 5

Number of Changing Keys,"You are given a 0-indexed string s typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, s = ""ab"" has a change of a key while s = ""bBBb"" does not have any.
Return the number of times the user had to change the key. 
Note: Modifiers like shift or caps lock won't be counted in changing the key that is if a user typed the letter 'a' and then the letter 'A' then it will not be considered as a changing of key.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""aAbBcC""
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From s[0] = 'a' to s[1] = 'A', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[1] = 'A' to s[2] = 'b', there is a change of key.
From s[2] = 'b' to s[3] = 'B', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.

Ant on the Boundary,"An ant is on a boundary. It sometimes goes left and sometimes right.
You are given an array of non-zero integers nums. The ant starts reading nums from the first element of it to its end. At each step, it moves according to the value of the current element:

If nums[i] < 0, it moves left by -nums[i] units.
If nums[i] > 0, it moves right by nums[i] units.

Return the number of times the ant returns to the boundary.
Notes:

There is an infinite space on both sides of the boundary.
We check whether the ant is on the boundary only after it has moved |nums[i]| units. In other words, if the ant crosses the boundary during its movement, it does not count.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-5]
Output: 1
Explanation: After the first step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the third step, the ant is on the boundary.
So the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,-3,-4]

Explanation: After the first step, the ant is 3 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the third step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the fourth step, the ant is 2 steps to the left of the boundary.

Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I,"You are given a 0-indexed string array words.
Let's define a boolean function isPrefixAndSuffix that takes two strings, str1 and str2:

isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2) returns true if str1 is both a prefix and a suffix of str2, and false otherwise.

For example, isPrefixAndSuffix(""aba"", ""ababa"") is true because ""aba"" is a prefix of ""ababa"" and also a suffix, but isPrefixAndSuffix(""abc"", ""abcd"") is false.
Return an integer denoting the number of index pairs (i, j) such that i < j, and isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j]) is true.
 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""a"",""aba"",""ababa"",""aa""]

Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""a"", ""aba"") is true.
i = 0 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""a"", ""ababa"") is true.
i = 0 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""a"", ""aa"") is true.
i = 1 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""aba"", ""ababa"") is true.

Return the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
 
Example 1:

Input: word = ""abacaba"", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters ""aba"" from the prefix of word, and add characters ""bac"" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to ""cababac"".
At the 2nd second, we remove characters ""cab"" from the prefix of word, and add ""aba"" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to ""abacaba"" and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.

Example 2:

Input: word = ""abacaba"", k = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters ""abac"" from the prefix of word, and add characters ""caba"" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to ""abacaba"" and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 1 second is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.

Example 3:

Input: word = ""abcbabcd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: At every second, we will remove the first 2 characters of word, and add the same characters to the end of word.
After 4 seconds, word becomes equal to ""abcbabcd"" and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 4 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.

Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.
In each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:

Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.
If nums[changeIndices[s]] is equal to 0, mark the index changeIndices[s].
Do nothing.

Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].
Second 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].
Second 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].
Second 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 7: Do nothing.
Second 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second.
Hence, the answer is 8.

Example 2:

Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,2].
Second 2: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,1].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,0].
Second 4: Mark the index changeIndices[4], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 5: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,0].

Find if Array Can Be Sorted,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.
In one operation, you can swap any two adjacent elements if they have the same number of set bits. You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).
Return true if you can sort the array, else return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]
Output: true
Explanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element. The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation ""10"", ""100"", and ""1000"" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation ""1111"" and ""11110"".
We can sort the array using 4 operations:
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].
The array has become sorted, hence we return true.
Note that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.

Example 2:

Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game,"Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a circular field surrounded by flowers. The circle represents the field, and there are x flowers in the clockwise direction between Alice and Bob, and y flowers in the anti-clockwise direction between them.
The game proceeds as follows:

Alice takes the first turn.
In each turn, a player must choose either the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and pick one flower from that side.
At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.

Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions:

Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
The number of flowers x in the clockwise direction must be in the range [1,n].

Two pixels are adjacent if they share an edge.
A region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold.
All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions.
You need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] belongs to multiple regions, result[i][j] is the average of the rounded-down average intensities of these regions, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] does not belong to any region, result[i][j] is equal to image[i][j].
Return the grid result.
 
Example 1:

Output: [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]
Explanation:

There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9.
Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.

Example 2:

Input: image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12
Output: [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]
Explanation:

There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27.
All the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result.

Example 3:

Input: image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1

Explanation:
There is only one 3 x 3 subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between image[0][0] and image[1][0] is |5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1. None of them belong to any valid regions, so the result should be the same as image.

Minimum Moves to Capture The Queen,"There is a 1-indexed 8 x 8 chessboard containing 3 pieces.
You are given 6 integers a, b, c, d, e, and f where:

(a, b) denotes the position of the white rook.
(c, d) denotes the position of the white bishop.
(e, f) denotes the position of the black queen.

Given that you can only move the white pieces, return the minimum number of moves required to capture the black queen.
Note that:

Rooks can move any number of squares either vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
Bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
A rook or a bishop can capture the queen if it is located in a square that they can move to.
The queen does not move.

 
Example 1:


Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 8, d = 8, e = 2, f = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can capture the black queen in two moves by moving the white rook to (1, 3) then to (2, 3).
It is impossible to capture the black queen in less than two moves since it is not being attacked by any of the pieces at the beginning.

Example 2:

Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros,"You are given an array of positive integers nums.
You have to check if it is possible to select two or more elements in the array such that the bitwise OR of the selected elements has at least one trailing zero in its binary representation.
For example, the binary representation of 5, which is ""101"", does not have any trailing zeros, whereas the binary representation of 4, which is ""100"", has two trailing zeros.
Return true if it is possible to select two or more elements whose bitwise OR has trailing zeros, return false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: If we select the elements 2 and 4, their bitwise OR is 6, which has the binary representation ""110"" with one trailing zero.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
Output: true
Explanation: If we select the elements 2 and 4, their bitwise OR is 6, which has the binary representation ""110"" with one trailing zero.
Other possible ways to select elements to have trailing zeroes in the binary representation of their bitwise OR are: (2, 8), (2, 16), (4, 8), (4, 16), (8, 16), (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 16), (2, 8, 16), (4, 8, 16), and (2, 4, 8, 16).

Return the array that contains beautiful indices in sorted order from smallest to largest.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""isawsquirrelnearmysquirrelhouseohmy"", a = ""my"", b = ""squirrel"", k = 15
Output: [16,33]
Explanation: There are 2 beautiful indices: [16,33].
- The index 16 is beautiful as s[16..17] == ""my"" and there exists an index 4 with s[4..11] == ""squirrel"" and |16 - 4| <= 15.
- The index 33 is beautiful as s[33..34] == ""my"" and there exists an index 18 with s[18..25] == ""squirrel"" and |33 - 18| <= 15.

Minimize Length of Array Using Operations,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing positive integers.
Your task is to minimize the length of nums by performing the following operations any number of times (including zero):

Select two distinct indices i and j from nums, such that nums[i] > 0 and nums[j] > 0.
Insert the result of nums[i] % nums[j] at the end of nums.
Delete the elements at indices i and j from nums.

Return an integer denoting the minimum length of nums after performing the operation any number of times.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows:
Operation 1: Select indices 2 and 1, insert nums[2] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [1,4,3,1,3], then delete elements at indices 2 and 1.
nums becomes [1,1,3].
Operation 2: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [1,1,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2.
nums becomes [1,1].
Operation 3: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [1,1,0], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0.

Count the Number of Powerful Integers,"You are given three integers start, finish, and limit. You are also given a 0-indexed string s representing a positive integer.
A positive integer x is called powerful if it ends with s (in other words, s is a suffix of x) and each digit in x is at most limit.
Return the total number of powerful integers in the range [start..finish].
A string x is a suffix of a string y if and only if x is a substring of y that starts from some index (including 0) in y and extends to the index y.length - 1. For example, 25 is a suffix of 5125 whereas 512 is not.
 
Example 1:

Input: start = 1, finish = 6000, limit = 4, s = ""124""
Output: 5
Explanation: The powerful integers in the range [1..6000] are 124, 1124, 2124, 3124, and, 4124. All these integers have each digit <= 4, and ""124"" as a suffix. Note that 5124 is not a powerful integer because the first digit is 5 which is greater than 4.
It can be shown that there are only 5 powerful integers in this range.

Example 2:

Input: start = 15, finish = 215, limit = 6, s = ""10""
Output: 2
Explanation: The powerful integers in the range [15..215] are 110 and 210. All these integers have each digit <= 6, and ""10"" as a suffix.

Explanation:
Different ways to divide nums into 2 arrays of size 3 are:

[[2,2,2],[2,4,5]] (and its permutations)
[[2,2,4],[2,2,5]] (and its permutations)

Because there are four 2s there will be an array with the elements 2 and 5 no matter how we divide it. since 5 - 2 = 3 > k, the condition is not satisfied and so there is no valid division.

You are also given two 0-indexed string arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of converting the string original[i] to the string changed[i].
You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a substring x from the string, and change it to y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y. You are allowed to do any number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy either of these two conditions:

The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with either b < c or d < a. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are disjoint.
The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with a == c and b == d. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are identical.

Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].

Output: 28
Explanation: To convert ""abcd"" to ""acbe"", do the following operations:
- Change substring source[1..1] from ""b"" to ""c"" at a cost of 5.
- Change substring source[2..2] from ""c"" to ""e"" at a cost of 1.
- Change substring source[2..2] from ""e"" to ""b"" at a cost of 2.
- Change substring source[3..3] from ""d"" to ""e"" at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.

- Change substring source[1..3] from ""bcd"" to ""cde"" at a cost of 1.
- Change substring source[5..7] from ""fgh"" to ""thh"" at a cost of 3. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation.
- Change substring source[5..7] from ""thh"" to ""ghh"" at a cost of 5. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation, and identical with indices picked in the second operation.
The total cost incurred is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations,"You are given a string s and an integer k.
First, you are allowed to change at most one index in s to another lowercase English letter.
After that, do the following partitioning operation until s is empty:

Choose the longest prefix of s containing at most k distinct characters.
Delete the prefix from s and increase the number of partitions by one. The remaining characters (if any) in s maintain their initial order.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""accca"", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[2] to something other than a and c, for example, b. then it becomes ""acbca"".
Then we perform the operations:

The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is ""ac"", we remove it and s becomes ""bca"".
Now The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is ""bc"", so we remove it and s becomes ""a"".
Finally, we remove ""a"" and s becomes empty, so the procedure ends.

Doing the operations, the string is divided into 3 partitions, so the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""aabaab"", k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
Initially s contains 2 distinct characters, so whichever character we change, it will contain at most 3 distinct characters, so the longest prefix with at most 3 distinct characters would always be all of it, therefore the answer is 1.

Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[0] or s[1] to something other than characters in s, for example, to change s[0] to w.

Minimum Cost to Make Array Equalindromic,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums having length n.
You are allowed to perform a special move any number of times (including zero) on nums. In one special move you perform the following steps in order:

Choose an index i in the range [0, n - 1], and a positive integer x.
Add |nums[i] - x| to the total cost.
Change the value of nums[i] to x.

A palindromic number is a positive integer that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121, 2552 and 65756 are palindromic numbers whereas 24, 46, 235 are not palindromic numbers.
An array is considered equalindromic if all the elements in the array are equal to an integer y, where y is a palindromic number less than 109.
Return an integer denoting the minimum possible total cost to make nums equalindromic by performing any number of special moves.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].
At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].
At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.

Find Maximum Non-decreasing Array Length,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
You can perform any number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a subarray of the array and replacing it with the sum of its elements. For example, if the given array is [1,3,5,6] and you select subarray [3,5] the array will convert to [1,8,6].
Return the maximum length of a non-decreasing array that can be made after applying operations.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: This array with length 3 is not non-decreasing.
We have two ways to make the array length two.
First, choosing subarray [2,2] converts the array to [5,4].
Second, choosing subarray [5,2] converts the array to [7,2].
In these two ways the array is not non-decreasing.
And if we choose subarray [5,2,2] and replace it with [9] it becomes non-decreasing. 
So the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The array is non-decreasing. So the answer is 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: Replacing [3,2] with [5] converts the given array to [4,5,6] that is non-decreasing.
Because the given array is not non-decreasing, the maximum possible answer is 3.

Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ai:bi], where 0 <= ai <= bi < n / 2.
Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ci:di], where n / 2 <= ci <= di < n.

For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing the operations.
Each query is answered independently of the others.
Return a 0-indexed array answer, where answer[i] == true if it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing operations specified by the ith query, and false otherwise.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
s[x:y] represents the substring consisting of characters from the index x to index y in s, both inclusive.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcabc"", queries = [[1,1,3,5],[0,2,5,5]]
Output: [true,true]
Explanation: In this example, there are two queries:
In the first query:
- a0 = 1, b0 = 1, c0 = 3, d0 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:1] => abcabc and s[3:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[3:5] can be rearranged to become => abccba.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.
In the second query:
- a1 = 0, b1 = 2, c1 = 5, d1 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abcabc and s[5:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[0:2] can be rearranged to become => cbaabc.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[1] = true.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbcdecbba"", queries = [[0,2,7,9]]
Output: [false]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 0, b0 = 2, c0 = 7, d0 = 9.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abbcdecbba and s[7:9] => abbcdecbba.
It is not possible to make s a palindrome by rearranging these substrings because s[3:6] is not a palindrome.
So, answer[0] = false.
Example 3:

Input: s = ""acbcab"", queries = [[1,2,4,5]]
Output: [true]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 1, b0 = 2, c0 = 4, d0 = 5.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:2] => acbcab and s[4:5] => acbcab.
To make s a palindrome s[1:2] can be rearranged to become abccab.
Then, s[4:5] can be rearranged to become abccba.
Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.

All entries in access_times are within the same day.
The access time is represented as four digits using a 24-hour time format, for example, ""0800"" or ""2250"".
An employee is said to be high-access if he has accessed the system three or more times within a one-hour period.
Times with exactly one hour of difference are not considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, ""0815"" and ""0915"" are not part of the same one-hour period.
Access times at the start and end of the day are not counted within the same one-hour period. For example, ""0005"" and ""2350"" are not part of the same one-hour period.

Explanation: ""a"" has three access times in the one-hour period of [05:32, 06:31] which are 05:32, 05:49, and 06:21.
But ""b"" does not have more than two access times at all.

Explanation: ""c"" has three access times in the one-hour period of [08:08, 09:07] which are 08:08, 08:09, and 08:29.
""d"" has also three access times in the one-hour period of [14:10, 15:09] which are 14:10, 14:44, and 15:08.
However, ""e"" has just one access time, so it can not be in the answer and the final answer is [""c"",""d""].
Example 3:

Input: access_times = [[""cd"",""1025""],[""ab"",""1025""],[""cd"",""1046""],[""cd"",""1055""],[""ab"",""1124""],[""ab"",""1120""]]
Output: [""ab"",""cd""]
Explanation: ""ab"" has three access times in the one-hour period of [10:25, 11:24] which are 10:25, 11:20, and 11:24.
""cd"" has also three access times in the one-hour period of [10:25, 11:24] which are 10:25, 10:46, and 10:55.

Maximum Strong Pair XOR I,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of integers x and y is called a strong pair if it satisfies the condition:

|x - y| <= min(x, y)

You need to select two integers from nums such that they form a strong pair and their bitwise XOR is the maximum among all strong pairs in the array.
Return the maximum XOR value out of all possible strong pairs in the array nums.
Note that you can pick the same integer twice to form a pair.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 11 strong pairs in the array nums: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5) and (5, 5).
The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is 3 XOR 4 = 7.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,100]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 2 strong pairs in the array nums: (10, 10) and (100, 100).
The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is 10 XOR 10 = 0 since the pair (100, 100) also gives 100 XOR 100 = 0.

Explanation: For x = 2, (a XOR x) = 14 and (b XOR x) = 7. Hence, (a XOR x) * (b XOR x) = 98. 
It can be shown that 98 is the maximum value of (a XOR x) * (b XOR x) for all 0 <= x < 2n.

Example 2:

Input: a = 6, b = 7 , n = 5

Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the ith node.
You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:

Pick any node i.
Add values[i] to your score.
Set values[i] to 0.

A tree is healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.
Return the maximum score you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
 
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]

- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] = 40.
It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

In an operation, you select an index i in the range [0, n - 1] and swap the values of nums1[i] and nums2[i].
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to satisfy the following conditions:

nums1[n - 1] is equal to the maximum value among all elements of nums1, i.e., nums1[n - 1] = max(nums1[0], nums1[1], ..., nums1[n - 1]).

Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.
Coins at nodei can be collected in one of the following ways:

Collect all the coins, but you will get coins[i] - k points. If coins[i] - k is negative then you will lose abs(coins[i] - k) points.

Last Visited Integers,"Given an integer array nums where nums[i] is either a positive integer or -1. We need to find for each -1 the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer.
To achieve this goal, let's define two empty arrays: seen and ans.
Start iterating from the beginning of the array nums.

If a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the front of seen.
If -1 is encountered, let k be the number of consecutive -1s seen so far (including the current -1),
	
If k is less than or equal to the length of seen, append the k-th element of seen to ans.
If k is strictly greater than the length of seen, append -1 to ans.



Return the array ans.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,-1,-1,-1]
Output: [2,1,-1]
Explanation:
Start with seen = [] and ans = [].

Process nums[0]: The first element in nums is 1. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [1].
Process nums[1]: The next element is 2. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [2, 1].
Process nums[2]: The next element is -1. This is the first occurrence of -1, so k == 1. We look for the first element in seen. We append 2 to ans. Now, ans == [2].
Process nums[3]: Another -1. This is the second consecutive -1, so k == 2. The second element in seen is 1, so we append 1 to ans. Now, ans == [2, 1].
Process nums[4]: Another -1, the third in a row, making k = 3. However, seen only has two elements ([2, 1]). Since k is greater than the number of elements in seen, we append -1 to ans. Finally, ans == [2, 1, -1].


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,-1,2,-1,-1]
Output: [1,2,1]
Explanation:
Start with seen = [] and ans = [].

Process nums[0]: The first element in nums is 1. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [1].
Process nums[1]: The next element is -1. This is the first occurrence of -1, so k == 1. We look for the first element in seen, which is 1. Append 1 to ans. Now, ans == [1].
Process nums[2]: The next element is 2. Prepend this to the front of seen. Now, seen == [2, 1].
Process nums[3]: The next element is -1. This -1 is not consecutive to the first -1 since 2 was in between. Thus, k resets to 1. The first element in seen is 2, so append 2 to ans. Now, ans == [1, 2].
Process nums[4]: Another -1. This is consecutive to the previous -1, so k == 2. The second element in seen is 1, append 1 to ans. Finally, ans == [1, 2, 1].

A sub-multiset is an unordered collection of elements of the array in which a given value x can occur 0, 1, ..., occ[x] times, where occ[x] is the number of occurrences of x in the array.
Note that:

Two sub-multisets are the same if sorting both sub-multisets results in identical multisets.
The sum of an empty multiset is 0.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3], l = 6, r = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The only subset of nums that has a sum of 6 is {1, 2, 3}.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,4,2,7], l = 1, r = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [1, 5] are {1}, {2}, {4}, {2, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 4}, and {1, 2, 2}.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,2], l = 3, r = 5

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose two indices, i and j, where nums[i] < nums[j].
Then, remove the elements at indices i and j from nums. The remaining elements retain their original order, and the array is re-indexed.

Return the minimum length of nums after applying the operation zero or more times.

Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays,"You are given an array nums consisting of non-negative integers.
We define the score of subarray nums[l..r] such that l <= r as nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] AND ... AND nums[r] where AND is the bitwise AND operation.
Consider splitting the array into one or more subarrays such that the following conditions are satisfied:

Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.
The sum of scores of the subarrays is the minimum possible.

Return the maximum number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,2,0,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can split the array into the following subarrays:
- [1,0]. The score of this subarray is 1 AND 0 = 0.
- [2,0]. The score of this subarray is 2 AND 0 = 0.
- [1,2]. The score of this subarray is 1 AND 2 = 0.
The sum of scores is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is the minimum possible score that we can obtain.
It can be shown that we cannot split the array into more than 3 subarrays with a total score of 0. So we return 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can split the array into one subarray: [5,7,1,3] with a score of 1, which is the minimum possible score that we can obtain.
It can be shown that we cannot split the array into more than 1 subarray with a total score of 1. So we return 1.

Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi with weight wi in the tree.
You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length m, where queries[i] = [ai, bi]. For each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make the weight of every edge on the path from ai to bi equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value.
Note that:

Queries are independent of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its initial state on each new query.
The path from ai to bi is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node ai and ending with node bi such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,2],[5,6,2]], queries = [[0,3],[3,6],[2,6],[0,6]]
Output: [0,0,1,3]
Explanation: In the first query, all the edges in the path from 0 to 3 have a weight of 1. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the second query, all the edges in the path from 3 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the third query, we change the weight of edge [2,3] to 2. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 2 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,1], [1,2] and [2,3] to 2. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.

Example 2:


Input: n = 8, edges = [[1,2,6],[1,3,4],[2,4,6],[2,5,3],[3,6,6],[3,0,8],[7,0,2]], queries = [[4,6],[0,4],[6,5],[7,4]]
Output: [1,2,2,3]
Explanation: In the first query, we change the weight of edge [1,3] to 6. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 4 to 6 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the second query, we change the weight of edges [0,3] and [3,1] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the third query, we change the weight of edges [1,3] and [5,2] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 6 to 5 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,7], [0,3] and [1,3] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 7 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.

Maximum Number of K-Divisible Components,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the ith node, and an integer k.
A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by k, where the value of a connected component is the sum of the values of its nodes.
Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 1 with 2. The resulting split is valid because:
- The value of the component containing nodes 1 and 3 is values[1] + values[3] = 12.
- The value of the component containing nodes 0, 2, and 4 is values[0] + values[2] + values[4] = 6.
It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 2 connected components.
Example 2:


Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 0 with 2, and the edge connecting node 0 with 1. The resulting split is valid because:
- The value of the component containing node 0 is values[0] = 3.
- The value of the component containing nodes 2, 5, and 6 is values[2] + values[5] + values[6] = 9.
- The value of the component containing nodes 1, 3, and 4 is values[1] + values[3] + values[4] = 6.
It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 3 connected components.

 
Constraints:

Count K-Subsequences of a String With Maximum Beauty,"You are given a string s and an integer k.
A k-subsequence is a subsequence of s, having length k, and all its characters are unique, i.e., every character occurs once.
Let f(c) denote the number of times the character c occurs in s.
The beauty of a k-subsequence is the sum of f(c) for every character c in the k-subsequence.
For example, consider s = ""abbbdd"" and k = 2:

f('a') = 1, f('b') = 3, f('d') = 2
Some k-subsequences of s are:
	
""abbbdd"" -> ""ab"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') = 4
""abbbdd"" -> ""ad"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('d') = 3
""abbbdd"" -> ""bd"" having a beauty of f('b') + f('d') = 5



Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all k-subsequences. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
Notes

f(c) is the number of times a character c occurs in s, not a k-subsequence.
Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""bcca"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.
The k-subsequences of s are: 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('a') = 2 
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3 
There are 4 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 3. 
Hence, the answer is 4. 

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbcd"", k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 2, f('c') = 1, and f('d') = 1. 
The k-subsequences of s are: 
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5 
There are 2 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 5. 
Hence, the answer is 2.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""010""

String Transformation,"You are given two strings s and t of equal length n. You can perform the following operation on the string s:

Remove a suffix of s of length l where 0 < l < n and append it at the start of s.
	For example, let s = 'abcd' then in one operation you can remove the suffix 'cd' and append it in front of s making s = 'cdab'.

You are also given an integer k. Return the number of ways in which s can be transformed into t in exactly k operations.
Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""cdab"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
First way:
In first operation, choose suffix from index = 3, so resulting s = ""dabc"".
In second operation, choose suffix from index = 3, so resulting s = ""cdab"".

Second way:
In first operation, choose suffix from index = 1, so resulting s = ""bcda"".

Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments,"You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.
In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.
Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.
Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
 
Example 1:

Input: str1 = ""abc"", str2 = ""ad""
Output: true
Explanation: Select index 2 in str1.
Increment str1[2] to become 'd'. 
Hence, str1 becomes ""abd"" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.
Example 2:

Input: str1 = ""zc"", str2 = ""ad""
Output: true
Explanation: Select indices 0 and 1 in str1. 
Increment str1[0] to become 'a'. 
Increment str1[1] to become 'd'. 
Hence, str1 becomes ""ad"" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.

Apply Operations to Maximize Score,"You are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.
Initially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times:

Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen previously.
Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.
Multiply your score by x.

Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.
The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
Output: 81
Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3
Output: 4788
Explanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations: 
- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.
- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 * 18 = 342.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 342 * 14 = 4788.
It can be proven that 4788 is the highest score one can obtain.

Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target,"Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer target, return the number of pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < n and nums[i] + nums[j] < target.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,1,2,3,1], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = 0 < target
- (0, 2) since 0 < 2 and nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 < target 
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = 0 < target

Check if it is Possible to Split Array,"You are given an array nums of length n and an integer m. You need to determine if it is possible to split the array into n arrays of size 1 by performing a series of steps.
An array is called good if:

The length of the array is one, or
The sum of the elements of the array is greater than or equal to m.

In each step, you can select an existing array (which may be the result of previous steps) with a length of at least two and split it into two arrays, if both resulting arrays are good.
Return true if you can split the given array into n arrays, otherwise return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 2, 1], m = 4
Output: true
Explanation:

Split [2, 2, 1] to [2, 2] and [1]. The array [1] has a length of one, and the array [2, 2] has the sum of its elements equal to 4 >= m, so both are good arrays.
Split [2, 2] to [2] and [2]. both arrays have the length of one, so both are good arrays.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 1, 3], m = 5
Output: false
Explanation:
The first move has to be either of the following:

Split [2, 1, 3] to [2, 1] and [3]. The array [2, 1] has neither length of one nor sum of elements greater than or equal to m.
Split [2, 1, 3] to [2] and [1, 3]. The array [1, 3] has neither length of one nor sum of elements greater than or equal to m.

So as both moves are invalid (they do not divide the array into two good arrays), we are unable to split nums into n arrays of size 1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3], m = 6
Output: true
Explanation:

Split [2, 3, 3, 2, 3] to [2] and [3, 3, 2, 3].

Count of Interesting Subarrays,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, an integer modulo, and an integer k.
Your task is to find the count of subarrays that are interesting.
A subarray nums[l..r] is interesting if the following condition holds:

Let cnt be the number of indices i in the range [l, r] such that nums[i] % modulo == k. Then, cnt % modulo == k.

Return an integer denoting the count of interesting subarrays. 
Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], modulo = 2, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example the interesting subarrays are: 
The subarray nums[0..0] which is [3]. 
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 0] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 1 and cnt % modulo == k.  
The subarray nums[0..1] which is [3,2].
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 1] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k.

It can be shown that there are no other interesting subarrays. So, the answer is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,9,6], modulo = 3, k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example the interesting subarrays are: 
The subarray nums[0..3] which is [3,1,9,6]. 
- There are three indices, i = 0, 2, 3, in the range [0, 3] that satisfy nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 3 and cnt % modulo == k.

A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0

You are initially positioned at cell (0, 0). In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.
The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.
Return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).
An adjacent cell of cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) and (r - 1, c) if it exists.
The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
 
Example 1:

We can select items[0] = [3,2] and items[2] = [10,1].
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 10 = 13, and the subsequence contains 2 distinct categories [2,1].

Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.

Sort Vowels in a String,"Given a 0-indexed string s, permute s to get a new string t such that:

All consonants remain in their original places. More formally, if there is an index i with 0 <= i < s.length such that s[i] is a consonant, then t[i] = s[i].
The vowels must be sorted in the nondecreasing order of their ASCII values. More formally, for pairs of indices i, j with 0 <= i < j < s.length such that s[i] and s[j] are vowels, then t[i] must not have a higher ASCII value than t[j].

Return the resulting string.
The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in lowercase or uppercase. Consonants comprise all letters that are not vowels.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""lEetcOde""

Example 1:

Input: words = [""one.two.three"",""four.five"",""six""], separator = "".""
Output: [""one"",""two"",""three"",""four"",""five"",""six""]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows:

""one.two.three"" splits into ""one"", ""two"", ""three""
""four.five"" splits into ""four"", ""five""
""six"" splits into ""six"" 

Hence, the resulting array is [""one"",""two"",""three"",""four"",""five"",""six""].
Example 2:

Input: words = [""$easy$"",""$problem$""], separator = ""$""
Output: [""easy"",""problem""]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows: 

""$easy$"" splits into ""easy"" (excluding empty strings)
""$problem$"" splits into ""problem"" (excluding empty strings)

Minimum Changes to Make K Semi-palindromes,"Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome are minimized.
Return the minimum number of letter changes required.
A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​

Choose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.
For a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.
The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.

Consider the string ""abcabc"":

The length of ""abcabc"" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.
For d = 1: The entire string ""abcabc"" forms one group. Not a palindrome.
For d = 2:
	
Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): ""acb""
Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): ""bac""
Neither group forms a palindrome.


For d = 3:
	
Group 1 (positions 1, 4): ""aa""
Group 2 (positions 2, 5): ""bb""
Group 3 (positions 3, 6): ""cc""
All groups form palindromes. Therefore, ""abcabc"" is a semi-palindrome.



 
Example 1: 

Input:   s = ""abcac"", k = 2 
Output:   1 
Explanation:  Divide s into ""ab"" and ""cac"". ""cac"" is already semi-palindrome. Change ""ab"" to ""aa"", it becomes semi-palindrome with d = 1.

Example 2: 

Input:   s = ""abcdef"", k = 2 
Output:   2 
Explanation:  Divide s into substrings ""abc"" and ""def"". Each needs one change to become semi-palindrome.

Example 3: 

Input:   s = ""aabbaa"", k = 3 
Output:   0 
Explanation:  Divide s into substrings ""aa"", ""bb"" and ""aa"". All are already semi-palindromes.

Interval Cancellation,"Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.
After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelTimeMs ms.
 
Example 1:

Create Object from Two Arrays,No description available.,Easy,,True
Sort By,"Given an array arr and a function fn, return a sorted array sortedArr. You can assume fn only returns numbers and those numbers determine the sort order of sortedArr. sortedArr must be sorted in ascending order by fn output.
You may assume that fn will never duplicate numbers for a given array.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [5, 4, 1, 2, 3], fn = (x) => x
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: fn simply returns the number passed to it so the array is sorted in ascending order.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [{""x"": 1}, {""x"": 0}, {""x"": -1}], fn = (d) => d.x
Output: [{""x"": -1}, {""x"": 0}, {""x"": 1}]
Explanation: fn returns the value for the ""x"" key. So the array is sorted based on that value.

Example 3:

Input: arr = [[3, 4], [5, 2], [10, 1]], fn = (x) => x[1]
Output: [[10, 1], [5, 2], [3, 4]]

Add Two Promises,"Given two promises promise1 and promise2, return a new promise. promise1 and promise2 will both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
Output: 7
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned promise resolves is not judged for this problem.

Example 2:

Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 50)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(-12), 30))
Output: -2
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 10 and -12 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 10 + -12 = -2.

Join Two Arrays by ID,"Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array joinedArray. All the objects in each of the two inputs arrays will contain an id field that has an integer value. 
joinedArray is an array formed by merging arr1 and arr2 based on their id key. The length of joinedArray should be the length of unique values of id. The returned array should be sorted in ascending order based on the id key.
If a given id exists in one array but not the other, the single object with that id should be included in the result array without modification.
If two objects share an id, their properties should be merged into a single object:

If a key only exists in one object, that single key-value pair should be included in the object.
If a key is included in both objects, the value in the object from arr2 should override the value from arr1.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
arr1 = [
    {""id"": 1, ""x"": 1},
    {""id"": 2, ""x"": 9}
], 
arr2 = [

Output: 
[
    {""id"": 1, ""x"": 1},
    {""id"": 2, ""x"": 9},
    {""id"": 3, ""x"": 5}
]
Explanation: There are no duplicate ids so arr1 is simply concatenated with arr2.

Example 2:

Input: 
arr1 = [
    {""id"": 1, ""x"": 2, ""y"": 3},
    {""id"": 2, ""x"": 3, ""y"": 6}
],

    {""id"": 2, ""x"": 10, ""y"": 20},
    {""id"": 3, ""x"": 0, ""y"": 0}
]
Explanation: The two objects with id=1 and id=3 are included in the result array without modifiction. The two objects with id=2 are merged together. The keys from arr2 override the values in arr1.

Example 3:

Input: 
arr1 = [
    {""id"": 1, ""b"": {""b"": 94},""v"": [4, 3], ""y"": 48}

]
Output: [
    {""id"": 1, ""b"": {""c"": 84}, ""v"": [1, 3], ""y"": 48}
]
Explanation: The two objects with id=1 are merged together. For the keys ""b"" and ""v"" the values from arr2 are used. Since the key ""y"" only exists in arr1, that value is taken form arr1.

- Jump from index 0 to index 1. 
- Jump from index 1 to index 3.
- Jump from index 3 to index 5.
It can be proven that there is no other jumping sequence that goes from 0 to n - 1 with more than 3 jumps. Hence, the answer is 3.

For example join(""ab"", ""ba"") = ""aba"" and join(""ab"", ""cde"") = ""abcde"".
You are to perform n - 1 join operations. Let str0 = words[0]. Starting from i = 1 up to i = n - 1, for the ith operation, you can do one of the following:

Make stri = join(stri - 1, words[i])
Make stri = join(words[i], stri - 1)

Your task is to minimize the length of strn - 1.
Return an integer denoting the minimum possible length of strn - 1.

Explanation: In this example, we can perform join operations in the following order to minimize the length of str2: 
str0 = ""aa""
str1 = join(str0, ""ab"") = ""aab""
str2 = join(str1, ""bc"") = ""aabc"" 
It can be shown that the minimum possible length of str2 is 4.
Example 2:

All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.

Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

Maximum Sum Queries,"You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, each of length n, and a 1-indexed 2D array queries where queries[i] = [xi, yi].
For the ith query, find the maximum value of nums1[j] + nums2[j] among all indices j (0 <= j < n), where nums1[j] >= xi and nums2[j] >= yi, or -1 if there is no j satisfying the constraints.
Return an array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]]
Output: [6,10,7]
Explanation: 
For the 1st query xi = 4 and yi = 1, we can select index j = 0 since nums1[j] >= 4 and nums2[j] >= 1. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.

For the 2nd query xi = 1 and yi = 3, we can select index j = 2 since nums1[j] >= 1 and nums2[j] >= 3. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 10, and we can show that 10 is the maximum we can obtain. 

For the 3rd query xi = 2 and yi = 5, we can select index j = 3 since nums1[j] >= 2 and nums2[j] >= 5. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 7, and we can show that 7 is the maximum we can obtain.

Therefore, we return [6,10,7].

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,3,4], queries = [[4,4],[3,2],[1,1]]
Output: [9,9,9]
Explanation: For this example, we can use index j = 2 for all the queries since it satisfies the constraints for each query.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [2,1], nums2 = [2,3], queries = [[3,3]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is one query in this example with xi = 3 and yi = 3. For every index, j, either nums1[j] < xi or nums2[j] < yi. Hence, there is no solution.

After completing all the steps, return the sorted list of occupied positions.
Notes:

We call a position occupied if there is at least one marble in that position.
There may be multiple marbles in a single position.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,6,7,8], moveFrom = [1,7,2], moveTo = [2,9,5]
Output: [5,6,8,9]
Explanation: Initially, the marbles are at positions 1,6,7,8.
At the i = 0th step, we move the marbles at position 1 to position 2. Then, positions 2,6,7,8 are occupied.
At the i = 1st step, we move the marbles at position 7 to position 9. Then, positions 2,6,8,9 are occupied.
At the i = 2nd step, we move the marbles at position 2 to position 5. Then, positions 5,6,8,9 are occupied.
At the end, the final positions containing at least one marbles are [5,6,8,9].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,3,3], moveFrom = [1,3], moveTo = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: Initially, the marbles are at positions [1,1,3,3].
At the i = 0th step, we move all the marbles at position 1 to position 2. Then, the marbles are at positions [2,2,3,3].
At the i = 1st step, we move all the marbles at position 3 to position 2. Then, the marbles are at positions [2,2,2,2].

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, logs = [[1,3],[2,6],[1,5]], x = 5, queries = [10,11]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
For queries[0]: The servers with ids 1 and 2 get requests in the duration of [5, 10]. Hence, only server 3 gets zero requests.
For queries[1]: Only the server with id 2 gets a request in duration of [6,11]. Hence, the servers with ids 1 and 3 are the only servers that do not receive any requests during that time period.

Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:
When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.
When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.
When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.

Your task is to determine if for every pair of indices i and j in nums, where i < j, there exists a sequence of traversals that can take us from i to j.
Return true if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: true
Explanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
To go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.
To go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1. Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1.

Minimum Cost to Make All Characters Equal,"You are given a 0-indexed binary string s of length n on which you can apply two types of operations:

Choose an index i and invert all characters from index 0 to index i (both inclusive), with a cost of i + 1
Choose an index i and invert all characters from index i to index n - 1 (both inclusive), with a cost of n - i

Return the minimum cost to make all characters of the string equal.
Invert a character means if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
 
Example 1:

Collecting Chocolates,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n representing the cost of collecting different chocolates. The cost of collecting the chocolate at the index i is nums[i]. Each chocolate is of a different type, and initially, the chocolate at the index i is of ith type.
In one operation, you can do the following with an incurred cost of x:

Simultaneously change the chocolate of ith type to ((i + 1) mod n)th type for all chocolates.

Return the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [20,1,15], x = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: Initially, the chocolate types are [0,1,2]. We will buy the 1st type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the types of chocolates will become [1,2,0]. We will buy the 2nd type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will again perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the chocolate types will become [2,0,1]. We will buy the 0th type of chocolate at a cost of 1. 
Thus, the total cost will become (1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1) = 13. We can prove that this is optimal.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], x = 4

Event Emitter,"Design an EventEmitter class. This interface is similar (but with some differences) to the one found in Node.js or the Event Target interface of the DOM. The EventEmitter should allow for subscribing to events and emitting them.
Your EventEmitter class should have the following two methods:

subscribe - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and a callback function. This callback function will later be called when the event is emitted.
	An event should be able to have multiple listeners for the same event. When emitting an event with multiple callbacks, each should be called in the order in which they were subscribed. An array of results should be returned. You can assume no callbacks passed to subscribe are referentially identical.
	The subscribe method should also return an object with an unsubscribe method that enables the user to unsubscribe. When it is called, the callback should be removed from the list of subscriptions and undefined should be returned.
emit - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and an optional array of arguments that will be passed to the callback(s). If there are no callbacks subscribed to the given event, return an empty array. Otherwise, return an array of the results of all callback calls in the order they were subscribed.

Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid,"You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:

From a cell (row, col), you can move to any of the cells: (row - 1, col + 1), (row, col + 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) such that the value of the cell you move to, should be strictly bigger than the value of the current cell.

Return the maximum number of moves that you can perform.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[2,4,3,5],[5,4,9,3],[3,4,2,11],[10,9,13,15]]

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.
A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]

Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.

Example 2:


Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.

Find the Losers of the Circular Game,"There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.
The rules of the game are as follows:
1st friend receives the ball.

After that, 1st friend passes it to the friend who is k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 2 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 3 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the ith turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is i * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.
The losers of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the entire game.
Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the array answer, which contains the losers of the game in the ascending order.
 
Example 1:

Call Function with Custom Context,"Enhance all functions to have the callPolyfill method. The method accepts an object obj as it's first parameter and any number of additional arguments. The obj becomes the this context for the function. The additional arguments are passed to the function (that the callPolyfill method belongs on).
For example if you had the function:

function tax(price, taxRate) {
  const totalCost = price * (1 + taxRate);
  console.log(`The cost of ${this.item} is ${totalCost}`);
}

Calling this function like tax(10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of undefined is 11"". This is because the this context was not defined.
However, calling the function like tax.callPolyfill({item: ""salad""}, 10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of salad is 11"". The this context was appropriately set, and the function logged an appropriate output.
Please solve this without using the built-in Function.call method.

Explanation:
fn.callPolyfill({""a"": 5}, 7); // 12

Design Cancellable Function,"Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise.
You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator.
If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string ""Cancelled"" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed.
When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.
An example of how your code would be used:

function* tasks() {
  const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2));
  yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done.
}
const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks());
setTimeout(cancel, 50);
promise.catch(console.log); // logs ""Cancelled"" at t=50ms

If instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  return 42; 
}
cancelledAt = 100
Output: {""resolved"": 42}
Explanation:
const generator = generatorFunction();
const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator);
setTimeout(cancel, 100);
promise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms

The generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing.

Example 2:

Input:
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(""Hello"")); 
  throw `Error: ${msg}`; 
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""rejected"": ""Error: Hello""}
Explanation:
A promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error.

Example 3:

Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); 
  return ""Success""; 
}
cancelledAt = 100
Output: {""rejected"": ""Cancelled""}
Explanation:
While the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error.

Example 4:

Input:
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  let result = 0; 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));
  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  return result;
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""resolved"": 2}
Explanation:
4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise.

Example 5:

Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  let result = 0; 
  try { 
    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  } catch(e) { 
    return result; 
  } 
  return result; 
}
cancelledAt = 150
Output: {""resolved"": 1}
Explanation:
The first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise.

Example 6:

Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  try { 
    yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(""Promise Rejected"")); 
  } catch(e) { 
    let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2));
    let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); 
    return a + b; 
  }; 
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""resolved"": 4}
Explanation:
The first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn't been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4.

cancelledAt == null or 0 <= cancelledAt <= 1000

Movement of Robots,"Some robots are standing on an infinite number line with their initial coordinates given by a 0-indexed integer array nums and will start moving once given the command to move. The robots will move a unit distance each second.
You are given a string s denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. 'L' means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas 'R' means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line.
If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions.

Note: 

For two robots at the index i and j, pair (i,j) and pair (j,i) are considered the same pair.
When robots collide, they instantly change their directions without wasting any time.
Collision happens when two robots share the same place in a moment.
	
For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 2 going to the left, the next second they'll be both in 1 and they will change direction and the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 2, heading right.

Find the Distinct Difference Array,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n.
The distinct difference array of nums is an array diff of length n such that diff[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] subtracted from the number of distinct elements in the prefix nums[0, ..., i].
Return the distinct difference array of nums.
Note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j inclusive. Particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.
For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.
For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]
Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 3 = -2.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
For index i = 2, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 2 - 2 = 0.
For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.
For index i = 4, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 3 - 0 = 3.

Maximum Sum With Exactly K Elements ,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:

Select an element m from nums.
Remove the selected element m from the array.
Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
Increase your score by m.

Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: 18
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
So, we will return 18.
It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2

A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.
 
Example 1:

Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.

Example 2:

Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]

Cache With Time Limit,"Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.
The class has three public methods:
set(key, value, duration): accepts an integer key, an integer value, and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.
get(key): if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return -1.
count(): returns the count of un-expired keys.
 
Example 1:

Input:

timeDelays = [0, 0, 50, 50, 150]
Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned.
At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache.
At t=100, key=1 expires.
At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.

timeDelays = [0, 0, 40, 50, 120, 200, 250]
Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten.
At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=140, key=1 expires.
At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned.

This result is achieved through the following operations: val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of val is then returned.
If the length of the array is 0, the function should return init.
Please solve it without using the built-in Array.reduce method.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr; }
init = 0

Explanation:
initially, the value is init=0.
(0) + nums[0] = 1
(1) + nums[1] = 3
(3) + nums[2] = 6
(6) + nums[3] = 10
The final answer is 10.

Example 2:

Input:

Snail Traversal,"Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the snail(rowsCount, colsCount) method that transforms the 1D array into a 2D array organised in the pattern known as snail traversal order. Invalid input values should output an empty array. If rowsCount * colsCount !== nums.length, the input is considered invalid.
Snail traversal order starts at the top left cell with the first value of the current array. It then moves through the entire first column from top to bottom, followed by moving to the next column on the right and traversing it from bottom to top. This pattern continues, alternating the direction of traversal with each column, until the entire current array is covered. For example, when given the input array [19, 10, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, 17, 16, 14, 12, 18, 6, 13, 11, 20, 4, 15] with rowsCount = 5 and colsCount = 4, the desired output matrix is shown below. Note that iterating the matrix following the arrows corresponds to the order of numbers in the original array.

Flatten Deeply Nested Array,"Given a multi-dimensional array arr and a depth n, return a flattened version of that array.
A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays.
A flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0.
Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.
 
Example 1:

Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 0
Output
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]

Explanation
Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. 
Example 2:

Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 1
Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15]

Explanation
The subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their depth of 0 is less than 1. However [9, 10, 11] remains unflattened because its depth is 1.
Example 3:

Input
arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 2
Output

There are no constraints on the data types that can be passed to the function. For example, the value or the class could be undefined.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: A date constructor cannot logically be an instance of itself.

Example 4:

Input: func = () => checkIfInstanceOf(5, Number)

Input: nums = [2,6,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[2] with gcd(3,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,6,1,4].
- Choose index i = 1 and replace nums[1] with gcd(6,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 0 and replace nums[0] with gcd(2,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[3] with gcd(1,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,10,6,14]

The time limited function should follow these rules:

If the fn completes within the time limit of t milliseconds, the time limited function should resolve with the result.
If the execution of the fn exceeds the time limit, the time limited function should reject with the string ""Time Limit Exceeded"".

 
Example 1:

Input:

filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.
Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,10,20,30], fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:

Memoize II,"Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.
A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.
fn can be any function and there are no constraints on what type of values it accepts. Inputs are considered identical if they are === to each other.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
getInputs = () => [[2,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
fn = function (a, b) { return a + b; }
Output: [{""val"":4,""calls"":1},{""val"":4,""calls"":1},{""val"":3,""calls"":2}]
Explanation:
const inputs = getInputs();
const memoized = memoize(fn);
for (const arr of inputs) {
  memoized(...arr);
}

For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, and it required a call to fn().
For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, but those inputs were seen before so no call to fn() was required.
For the inputs of (1, 2): 1 + 2 = 3, and it required another call to fn() for a total of 2.

Example 2:

Input: 
getInputs = () => [[{},{}],[{},{}],[{},{}]] 
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
Output: [{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":2},{""val"":{},""calls"":3}]
Explanation:
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. It may seem like there should only be 1 call to fn() because of cache-hits, however none of those objects are === to each other.

Example 3:

Input: 
getInputs = () => { const o = {}; return [[o,o],[o,o],[o,o]]; }
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
Output: [{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":1}]
Explanation:
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. The 2nd and 3rd third function calls result in a cache-hit. This is because every object passed in is identical.

Debounce,"Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.
A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.
For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms.
The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms.
If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.

The above diagram shows how debounce will transform events. Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.
Please solve it without using lodash's _.debounce() function.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
t = 50
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {""t"": 75, inputs: [2]}
]

  console.log([Date.now() - start, inputs ])
}
const dlog = debounce(log, 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(1), 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(2), 75);

The 1st call is cancelled by the 2nd call because the 2nd call occurred before 100ms
The 2nd call is delayed by 50ms and executed at 125ms. The inputs were (2).

Example 2:

Input: 
t = 20
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {""t"": 100, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 70, inputs: [1]}, {""t"": 120, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
The 1st call is delayed until 70ms. The inputs were (1).
The 2nd call is delayed until 120ms. The inputs were (2).

Example 3:

  {""t"": 300, inputs: [5, 6]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 200, inputs: [1,2]}, {""t"": 450, inputs: [5, 6]}]
Explanation:
The 1st call is delayed by 150ms and ran at 200ms. The inputs were (1, 2).

Group By,"Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.
A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array which generate that key.
The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.
The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.
Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
array = [
  {""id"":""1""},
  {""id"":""1""},
  {""id"":""2""}
], 
fn = function (item) { 
  return item.id; 
}
Output: 
{ 
  ""1"": [{""id"": ""1""}, {""id"": ""1""}],   
  ""2"": [{""id"": ""2""}] 
}
Explanation:
Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
The selector function gets the ""id"" out of each item in the array.
There are two objects with an ""id"" of 1. Both of those objects are put in the first array.
There is one object with an ""id"" of 2. That object is put in the second array.

Example 2:

  return String(list[0]); 
}
Output: 
{ 
  ""1"": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]] 
}
Explanation:
The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the key as being the first element in the array. 
All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.
{
  ""1"": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]

Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price, where price[i] is the price of the ith node.
The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.
Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array trips, where trips[i] = [starti, endi] indicates that you start the ith trip from the node starti and travel to the node endi by any path you like.
Before performing your first trip, you can choose some non-adjacent nodes and halve the prices.

Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2. The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree after choosing nodes 0, 2, and 3, and making their price half.
For the 1st trip, we choose path [0,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
For the 2nd trip, we choose path [2,1]. The price sum of that path is 2 + 5 = 7.
For the 3rd trip, we choose path [2,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 5 + 2 + 3 = 10.
The total price sum of all trips is 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
It can be proven, that 23 is the minimum answer that we can achieve.

Example 2:

From each row in the matrix, select the largest number and remove it. In the case of a tie, it does not matter which number is chosen.
Identify the highest number amongst all those removed in step 1. Add that number to your score.

Return the final score.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [[7,2,1],[6,4,2],[6,5,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 15
Explanation: In the first operation, we remove 7, 6, 6, and 3. We then add 7 to our score. Next, we remove 2, 4, 5, and 2. We add 5 to our score. Lastly, we remove 1, 2, 3, and 1. We add 3 to our score. Thus, our final score is 7 + 5 + 3 = 15.

Reverse a subarray with size k if the single 1 is not set to a position in banned.

Return an integer array answer with n results where the ith result is the minimum number of operations needed to bring the single 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4
Output: [0,-1,-1,1]
Explanation:

Initially 1 is placed at position 0 so the number of operations we need for position 0 is 0.
We can never place 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1.
Perform the operation of size 4 to reverse the whole array.
After a single operation 1 is at position 3 so the answer for position 3 is 1.


Example 2:

Input: n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3
Output: [0,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation:

Initially 1 is placed at position 0 so the number of operations we need for position 0 is 0.
We cannot perform the operation on the subarray positions [0, 2] because position 2 is in banned.
Because 1 cannot be set at position 2, it is impossible to set 1 at other positions in more operations.


Example 3:

Explanation: 
When i = 0, nums[0] == nums[2] and nums[0] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[0] = |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5. 
When i = 1, arr[1] = 0 because there is no other index with value 3.
When i = 2, nums[2] == nums[0] and nums[2] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[2] = |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3.

Increase or decrease an element of the array by 1.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to queries[i].
Note that after each query the array is reset to its original state.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,6,8], queries = [1,5]
Output: [14,10]
Explanation: For the first query we can do the following operations:
- Decrease nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [1,1,6,8].
- Decrease nums[2] 5 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,8].
- Decrease nums[3] 7 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,1].
So the total number of operations for the first query is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14.
For the second query we can do the following operations:
- Increase nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [5,1,6,8].
- Increase nums[1] 4 times, so that nums = [5,5,6,8].
- Decrease nums[2] 1 time, so that nums = [5,5,5,8].
- Decrease nums[3] 3 times, so that nums = [5,5,5,5].
So the total number of operations for the second query is 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 10.

A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]

Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0,"You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any number of times:

Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.

Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.
A number x is power of 2 if x == 2i where i >= 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 39
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
- Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
- Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.

Example 2:

A square-free integer is an integer that is divisible by no square number other than 1.
Return the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array nums. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A non-empty subset of nums is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from nums. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,4,5]

lcp[i][j] is equal to the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings word[i,n-1] and word[j,n-1].

Given an n x n matrix lcp, return the alphabetically smallest string word that corresponds to lcp. If there is no such string, return an empty string.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, ""aabd"" is lexicographically smaller than ""aaca"" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and 'b' comes before 'c'.
 
Example 1:

Input: lcp = [[4,0,2,0],[0,3,0,1],[2,0,2,0],[0,1,0,1]]

Notes:

When Bob remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2, Bob replaces all occurrences of d1 in num with d2.
Bob can remap a digit to itself, in which case num does not change.
Bob can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.

 
Example 1:

Then the score of the string is right - left + 1.
Return the minimum possible score to make t a subsequence of s.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ""ace"" is a subsequence of ""abcde"" while ""aec"" is not).

Explanation: For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is ""101"" which has a decimal value of 5, and 5 ^ 0 = 5, hence the answer to the first query is [0,2]. In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is ""11"", and has a decimal value of 3, and 3 ^ 1 = 2. So, [2,3] is returned for the second query.

If there exists more than one number in nums, pick the first element and last element in nums respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the concatenation value of nums, then delete the first and last element from nums.
If one element exists, add its value to the concatenation value of nums, then delete it.

Return the concatenation value of the nums.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.
 - In the first operation:
We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.
Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.
Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].
 - In the second operation:
We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.
Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.

We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12.
Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].
 - In the second operation:
We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8.
Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13].
 - In the third operation:
nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673.
Then we delete it from nums, so nums become empty.

House Robber IV,"There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent homes.
The capability of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.
You are given an integer array nums representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the ith house from the left has nums[i] dollars.
You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least k houses.
Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least k houses.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.

Rearranging Fruits,"You have two fruit baskets containing n fruits each. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays basket1 and basket2 representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

Chose two indices i and j, and swap the ith fruit of basket1 with the jth fruit of basket2.
The cost of the swap is min(basket1[i],basket2[j]).

Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.
Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or -1 if impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.

Find the Substring With Maximum Cost,"You are given a string s, a string chars of distinct characters and an integer array vals of the same length as chars.
The cost of the substring is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered 0.
The value of the character is defined in the following way:

If the character is not in the string chars, then its value is its corresponding position (1-indexed) in the alphabet.

	
For example, the value of 'a' is 1, the value of 'b' is 2, and so on. The value of 'z' is 26.


Otherwise, assuming i is the index where the character occurs in the string chars, then its value is vals[i].

Return the maximum cost among all substrings of the string s.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""adaa"", chars = ""d"", vals = [-1000]
Output: 2
Explanation: The value of the characters ""a"" and ""d"" is 1 and -1000 respectively.

Time to Cross a Bridge,"There are k workers who want to move n boxes from the right (old) warehouse to the left (new) warehouse. You are given the two integers n and k, and a 2D integer array time of size k x 4 where time[i] = [righti, picki, lefti, puti].
The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the ith worker can do the following:

Cross the bridge to the right side in righti minutes.
Pick a box from the right warehouse in picki minutes.
Cross the bridge to the left side in lefti minutes.
Put the box into the left warehouse in puti minutes.

The ith worker is less efficient than the jth worker if either condition is met:

lefti + righti > leftj + rightj
lefti + righti == leftj + rightj and i > j

The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge:

Only one worker can use the bridge at a time.
When the bridge is unused prioritize the least efficient worker on the right side to cross. If there are no workers on the right side, prioritize the least efficient worker on the left side to cross.
If enough workers have already been dispatched from the left side to pick up all the remaining boxes, no more workers will be sent from the left side.

Return the elapsed minutes at which the last box reaches the left side of the bridge.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 3, time = [[1,1,2,1],[1,1,3,1],[1,1,4,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:

From 0 to 1 minutes: worker 2 crosses the bridge to the right.
From 1 to 2 minutes: worker 2 picks up a box from the right warehouse.
From 2 to 6 minutes: worker 2 crosses the bridge to the left.
From 6 to 7 minutes: worker 2 puts a box at the left warehouse.
The whole process ends after 7 minutes. We return 6 because the problem asks for the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left side of the bridge.

Maximum Subsequence Score,"You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.
For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).

Return the maximum possible score.
A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.

Minimum Cost to Split an Array,"You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
Split the array into some number of non-empty subarrays. The cost of a split is the sum of the importance value of each subarray in the split.
Let trimmed(subarray) be the version of the subarray where all numbers which appear only once are removed.

For example, trimmed([3,1,2,4,3,4]) = [3,4,3,4].

The importance value of a subarray is k + trimmed(subarray).length.

For example, if a subarray is [1,2,3,3,3,4,4], then trimmed([1,2,3,3,3,4,4]) = [3,3,3,4,4].The importance value of this subarray will be k + 5.

The box is ""Bulky"" if:

	
Any of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.
Or, the volume of the box is greater or equal to 109.


If the mass of the box is greater or equal to 100, it is ""Heavy"".
If the box is both ""Bulky"" and ""Heavy"", then its category is ""Both"".
If the box is neither ""Bulky"" nor ""Heavy"", then its category is ""Neither"".
If the box is ""Bulky"" but not ""Heavy"", then its category is ""Bulky"".
If the box is ""Heavy"" but not ""Bulky"", then its category is ""Heavy"".

Note that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and height.
 
Example 1:

Input: length = 1000, width = 35, height = 700, mass = 300
Output: ""Heavy""
Explanation: 
None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104. 
Its volume = 24500000 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".
However mass >= 100, so the box is ""Heavy"".
Since the box is not ""Bulky"" but ""Heavy"", we return ""Heavy"".
Example 2:

Input: length = 200, width = 50, height = 800, mass = 50
Output: ""Neither""
Explanation: 
None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.
Its volume = 8 * 106 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".
Its mass is also less than 100, so it cannot be categorized as ""Heavy"" either.

Maximize the Minimum Powered City,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.
Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.
The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.
Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.
Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
 
Example 1:

Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.

Cycle Length Queries in a Tree,"You are given an integer n. There is a complete binary tree with 2n - 1 nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value 1, and every node with a value val in the range [1, 2n - 1 - 1] has two children where:

The left node has the value 2 * val, and
The right node has the value 2 * val + 1.

Add an edge between the nodes with values ai and bi.
Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
Remove the added edge between nodes with values ai and bi.

Note that:

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 3, queries = [[5,3],[4,7],[2,3]]

Explanation: The diagrams above show the tree of 23 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 3 and 5, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [5,2,1,3]. Thus answer to the first query is 4. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 4 and 7, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [4,2,1,3,7]. Thus answer to the second query is 5. We delete the added edge and process the next query.

Return the minimum total cost such that nums1 and nums2 satisfy the above condition. In case it is not possible, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 0 and 3, incurring cost = 0 + 3 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,2,3,1,5]
- Swap values at indices 1 and 2, incurring cost = 1 + 2 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,3,2,1,5].
- Swap values at indices 0 and 4, incurring cost = 0 + 4 = 4. Now, nums1 =[5,3,2,1,4].
We can see that for each index i, nums1[i] != nums2[i]. The cost required here is 10.
Note that there are other ways to swap values, but it can be proven that it is not possible to obtain a cost less than 10.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,2,2,1,3], nums2 = [1,2,2,3,3]

Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 2 and 3, incurring cost = 2 + 3 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,2,1,2,3].
- Swap values at indices 1 and 4, incurring cost = 1 + 4 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,3,1,2,2].
The total cost needed here is 10, which is the minimum possible.

A frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone at most once.
The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.

More formally, if the frog is at stones[i] and is jumping to stones[j], the length of the jump is |stones[i] - stones[j]|.

The cost of a path is the maximum length of a jump among all jumps in the path.
Return the minimum cost of a path for the frog.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: 
- ""alic3"" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- ""bob"" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- ""3"" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.

Minimum Penalty for a Shop,"You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.

If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:

For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.

Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.
Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.
 
Example 1:

Input: customers = ""YYNY""
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.

Output: [[2,2],[4,6],[15,-1]]
Explanation: We answer the queries in the following way:
- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 2 in the tree is 2, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 2 is still 2. So the answer for the first query is [2,2].
- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 5 in the tree is 4, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 5 is 6. So the answer for the second query is [4,6].
- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 16 in the tree is 15, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 16 does not exist. So the answer for the third query is [15,-1].

Most Profitable Path in a Tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
At every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:

the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,
the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.
At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.
For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
	
If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.


If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.

Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.
 
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280.

Minimum Total Distance Traveled,"There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array robot where robot[i] is the position of the ith robot. You are also given a 2D integer array factory where factory[j] = [positionj, limitj] indicates that positionj is the position of the jth factory and that the jth factory can repair at most limitj robots.
The positions of each robot are unique. The positions of each factory are also unique. Note that a robot can be in the same position as a factory initially.
All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.
At any moment, you can set the initial direction of moving for some robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.
Return the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.
Note that

All robots move at the same speed.
If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
If the robot moved from a position x to a position y, the distance it moved is |y - x|.

 
Example 1:


Input: robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: As shown in the figure:
- The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
- The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
- The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.
The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.

Example 2:


Input: robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]]

Explanation: As shown in the figure:
- The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.
- The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.

Total Cost to Hire K Workers,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.
You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:

You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
	
For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.


If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
A worker can only be chosen once.

Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.
 
Example 1:

Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
Output: 11
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.

Example 2:

Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3

Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.

Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return 0.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3

Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.

Apply Operations to an Array,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums of size n consisting of non-negative integers.
You need to apply n - 1 operations to this array where, in the ith operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the ith element of nums:

If nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then multiply nums[i] by 2 and set nums[i + 1] to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.

After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.

For example, the array [1,0,2,0,0,1] after shifting all its 0's to the end, is [1,2,1,0,0,0].

Return the resulting array.
Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
Explanation: We do the following operations:
- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
- i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].

Return a list of all words from queries, that match with some word from dictionary after a maximum of two edits. Return the words in the same order they appear in queries.
 
Example 1:

Input: queries = [""word"",""note"",""ants"",""wood""], dictionary = [""wood"",""joke"",""moat""]
Output: [""word"",""note"",""wood""]
Explanation:
- Changing the 'r' in ""word"" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word ""wood"".
- Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in ""note"" changes it to ""joke"".
- It would take more than 2 edits for ""ants"" to equal a dictionary word.
- ""wood"" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.
Thus, we return [""word"",""note"",""wood""].

Example 2:

Input: queries = [""yes""], dictionary = [""not""]

There exists exactly one index k such that nums[k] > nums[i] and i < k < j.

If there is no such nums[j], the second greater integer is considered to be -1.

For example, in the array [1, 2, 4, 3], the second greater integer of 1 is 4, 2 is 3, and that of 3 and 4 is -1.

Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the second greater integer of nums[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,4,0,9,6]

Explanation:
0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.
1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.

Two arrays are considered to be similar if the frequency of each element is the same.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums similar to target. The test cases are generated such that nums can always be similar to target.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,12,6], target = [2,14,10]
Output: 2
Explanation: It is possible to make nums similar to target in two operations:
- Choose i = 0 and j = 2, nums = [10,12,4].
- Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [10,14,2].
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,5], target = [4,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can make nums similar to target in one operation:
- Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [1,4,3].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = [1,1,1,1,1]

Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal,"You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.
You can do the following operation any number of times:

Increase or decrease any element of the array nums by 1.

The cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].
Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
Output: 8
Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
- Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
- Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
- Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.
A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).
Return true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: event1 = [""01:15"",""02:00""], event2 = [""02:00"",""03:00""]

Bitwise XOR of All Pairings,"You are given two 0-indexed arrays, nums1 and nums2, consisting of non-negative integers. There exists another array, nums3, which contains the bitwise XOR of all pairings of integers between nums1 and nums2 (every integer in nums1 is paired with every integer in nums2 exactly once).
Return the bitwise XOR of all integers in nums3.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,1,3], nums2 = [10,2,5,0]
Output: 13
Explanation:
A possible nums3 array is [8,0,7,2,11,3,4,1,9,1,6,3].
The bitwise XOR of all these numbers is 13, so we return 13.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation:
All possible pairs of bitwise XORs are nums1[0] ^ nums2[0], nums1[0] ^ nums2[1], nums1[1] ^ nums2[0],
and nums1[1] ^ nums2[1].
Thus, one possible nums3 array is [2,5,1,6].

Create Components With Same Value,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are allowed to delete some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the value of a component be the sum of all nums[i] for which node i is in the component.
Return the maximum number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value.
 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [6,2,2,2,6], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]] 
Output: 2 
Explanation: The above figure shows how we can delete the edges [0,1] and [3,4]. The created components are nodes [0], [1,2,3] and [4]. The sum of the values in each component equals 6. It can be proven that no better deletion exists, so the answer is 2.

Minimize Maximum of Array,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums comprising of n non-negative integers.
In one operation, you must:

Choose an integer i such that 1 <= i < n and nums[i] > 0.
Decrease nums[i] by 1.
Increase nums[i - 1] by 1.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer of nums after performing any number of operations.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,7,1,6]
Output: 5
Explanation:
One set of optimal operations is as follows:
1. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [4,6,1,6].
2. Choose i = 3, and nums becomes [4,6,2,5].
3. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [5,5,2,5].
The maximum integer of nums is 5. It can be shown that the maximum number cannot be less than 5.
Therefore, we return 5.

Range Product Queries of Powers,"Given a positive integer n, there exists a 0-indexed array called powers, composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.
You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [lefti, righti]. Each queries[i] represents a query where you have to find the product of all powers[j] with lefti <= j <= righti.
Return an array answers, equal in length to queries, where answers[i] is the answer to the ith query. Since the answer to the ith query may be too large, each answers[i] should be returned modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
Output: [2,4,64]
Explanation:
For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
Answer to 1st query: powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2.
Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.
Answer to 3rd query: powers[0] * powers[1] * powers[2] * powers[3] = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 = 64.
Each answer modulo 109 + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
For n = 2, powers = [2].
The answer to the only query is powers[0] = 2. The answer modulo 109 + 7 is the same, so [2] is returned.

Return an integer answer, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every ? with a digit from 0 to 9.
 
Example 1:

Input: time = ""?5:00""
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the ? with either a 0 or 1, producing ""05:00"" or ""15:00"". Note that we cannot replace it with a 2, since the time ""25:00"" is invalid. In total, we have two choices.

Example 2:

Input: time = ""0?:0?""
Output: 100
Explanation: Each ? can be replaced by any digit from 0 to 9, so we have 100 total choices.

Partition String Into Substrings With Values at Most K,"You are given a string s consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and an integer k.
A partition of a string s is called good if:

Each digit of s is part of exactly one substring.
The value of each substring is less than or equal to k.

Return the minimum number of substrings in a good partition of s. If no good partition of s exists, return -1.
Note that:

The value of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. For example, the value of ""123"" is 123 and the value of ""1"" is 1.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""165462"", k = 60
Output: 4
Explanation: We can partition the string into substrings ""16"", ""54"", ""6"", and ""2"". Each substring has a value less than or equal to k = 60.
It can be shown that we cannot partition the string into less than 4 substrings.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""238182"", k = 5

Maximum Deletions on a String,"You are given a string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:

Delete the entire string s, or
Delete the first i letters of s if the first i letters of s are equal to the following i letters in s, for any i in the range 1 <= i <= s.length / 2.

For example, if s = ""ababc"", then in one operation, you could delete the first two letters of s to get ""abc"", since the first two letters of s and the following two letters of s are both equal to ""ab"".
Return the maximum number of operations needed to delete all of s.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcabcdabc""
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Delete the first 3 letters (""abc"") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = ""abcdabc"".
- Delete all the letters.
We used 2 operations so return 2. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of operations needed.
Note that in the second operation we cannot delete ""abc"" again because the next occurrence of ""abc"" does not happen in the next 3 letters.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""aaabaab""
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Delete the first letter (""a"") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = ""aabaab"".
- Delete the first 3 letters (""aab"") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = ""aab"".
- Delete the first letter (""a"") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = ""ab"".

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.
Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at i with maximum bitwise OR.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,2,1,3]
Output: [3,3,2,2,1]
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise OR starting at any index is 3. 
- Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields it is [1,0,2].
- Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [0,2,1].
- Starting at index 2, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [2,1].
- Starting at index 3, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [1,3].

Task Scheduler II,"You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers tasks, representing tasks that need to be completed in order, where tasks[i] represents the type of the ith task.
You are also given a positive integer space, which represents the minimum number of days that must pass after the completion of a task before another task of the same type can be performed.
Each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:

Complete the next task from tasks, or
Take a break.

Return the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.
 
Example 1:

Input: tasks = [1,2,1,2,3,1], space = 3

Maximum Rows Covered by Columns,"You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix and an integer numSelect.
Your goal is to select exactly numSelect distinct columns from matrix such that you cover as many rows as possible.
A row is considered covered if all the 1's in that row are also part of a column that you have selected. If a row does not have any 1s, it is also considered covered.
More formally, let us consider selected = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect} as the set of columns selected by you. A row i is covered by selected if:

For each cell where matrix[i][j] == 1, the column j is in selected.
Or, no cell in row i has a value of 1.

Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by a set of numSelect columns.
 
Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
Thus, we can cover three rows.
Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.

Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1],[0]], numSelect = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected.

Strictly Palindromic Number,"An integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2 (inclusive), the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic.
Given an integer n, return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 9
Output: false
Explanation: In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.
In base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.
Note that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.
Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.

Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.
A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]

Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.

- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.

- 3 AND 8 = 0.
- 3 AND 48 = 0.
- 8 AND 48 = 0.
It can be proven that no longer nice subarray can be obtained, so we return 3.

Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps,"You are given two positive integers startPos and endPos. Initially, you are standing at position startPos on an infinite number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.
Given a positive integer k, return the number of different ways to reach the position endPos starting from startPos, such that you perform exactly k steps. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Two ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not exactly the same.
Note that the number line includes negative integers.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).
In a well-spaced string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. If the ith letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.
Return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abaccb"", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.

The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.
You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.
The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.

Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.
 
Example 1:


Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.

Example 2:

Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]

5. Travels from house 2 to house 3
6. Collects the glass garbage at house 3
Altogether, it takes 13 minutes to pick up all the glass garbage.
Since there is no metal garbage, we do not need to consider the metal garbage truck.
Therefore, it takes a total of 8 + 13 = 21 minutes to collect all the garbage.

Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition,"You are entering a competition, and are given two positive integers initialEnergy and initialExperience denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.
You are also given two 0-indexed integer arrays energy and experience, both of length n.
You will face n opponents in order. The energy and experience of the ith opponent is denoted by energy[i] and experience[i] respectively. When you face an opponent, you need to have both strictly greater experience and energy to defeat them and move to the next opponent if available.
Defeating the ith opponent increases your experience by experience[i], but decreases your energy by energy[i].
Before starting the competition, you can train for some number of hours. After each hour of training, you can either choose to increase your initial experience by one, or increase your initial energy by one.
Return the minimum number of training hours required to defeat all n opponents.

Explanation: You can increase your energy to 11 after 6 hours of training, and your experience to 5 after 2 hours of training.
You face the opponents in the following order:
- You have more energy and experience than the 0th opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and your experience becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
- You have more energy and experience than the 1st opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 10 - 4 = 6, and your experience becomes 7 + 6 = 13.

- 1st group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1
- 2nd group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2
- 3rd group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3
It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.

Example 2:

Input: grades = [8,8]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can only form 1 group, since forming 2 groups would lead to an equal number of students in both groups.

Number of Excellent Pairs,"You are given a 0-indexed positive integer array nums and a positive integer k.
A pair of numbers (num1, num2) is called excellent if the following conditions are satisfied:

Both the numbers num1 and num2 exist in the array nums.
The sum of the number of set bits in num1 OR num2 and num1 AND num2 is greater than or equal to k, where OR is the bitwise OR operation and AND is the bitwise AND operation.

Return the number of distinct excellent pairs.
Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are considered distinct if either a != c or b != d. For example, (1, 2) and (2, 1) are distinct.
Note that a pair (num1, num2) such that num1 == num2 can also be excellent if you have at least one occurrence of num1 in the array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The excellent pairs are the following:
- (3, 3). (3 AND 3) and (3 OR 3) are both equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than or equal to k = 3.
- (2, 3) and (3, 2). (2 AND 3) is equal to (10) in binary, and (2 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.
- (1, 3) and (3, 1). (1 AND 3) is equal to (01) in binary, and (1 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.

Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.

The evaluation of a node is as follows:

If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.
A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.
A leaf node is a node that has zero children.
 
Example 1:


Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
Example 2:

Input: root = [0]

A 0-indexed integer array arr of length n is considered ideal if the following conditions hold:

Every arr[i] is a value from 1 to maxValue, for 0 <= i < n.
Every arr[i] is divisible by arr[i - 1], for 0 < i < n.

Return the number of distinct ideal arrays of length n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Move Pieces to Obtain a String,"You are given two strings start and target, both of length n. Each string consists only of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' where:

The characters 'L' and 'R' represent pieces, where a piece 'L' can move to the left only if there is a blank space directly to its left, and a piece 'R' can move to the right only if there is a blank space directly to its right.
The character '_' represents a blank space that can be occupied by any of the 'L' or 'R' pieces.

Return true if it is possible to obtain the string target by moving the pieces of the string start any number of times. Otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: start = ""_L__R__R_"", target = ""L______RR""
Output: true
Explanation: We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to ""L___R__R_"".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to ""L___R___R"".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to ""L______RR"".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.

Example 2:

Input: start = ""R_L_"", target = ""__LR""
Output: false
Explanation: The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain ""_RL_"".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

Example 3:

Input: start = ""_R"", target = ""R_""
Output: false
Explanation: The piece in the string start can move only to the right, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Every subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.
[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.
Thus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.

Match Substring After Replacement,"You are given two strings s and sub. You are also given a 2D character array mappings where mappings[i] = [oldi, newi] indicates that you may perform the following operation any number of times:

Replace a character oldi of sub with newi.

Each character in sub cannot be replaced more than once.
Return true if it is possible to make sub a substring of s by replacing zero or more characters according to mappings. Otherwise, return false.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""fool3e7bar"", sub = ""leet"", mappings = [[""e"",""3""],[""t"",""7""],[""t"",""8""]]
Output: true
Explanation: Replace the first 'e' in sub with '3' and 't' in sub with '7'.
Now sub = ""l3e7"" is a substring of s, so we return true.
Example 2:

Input: s = ""fooleetbar"", sub = ""f00l"", mappings = [[""o"",""0""]]
Output: false
Explanation: The string ""f00l"" is not a substring of s and no replacements can be made.
Note that we cannot replace '0' with 'o'.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""Fool33tbaR"", sub = ""leetd"", mappings = [[""e"",""3""],[""t"",""7""],[""t"",""8""],[""d"",""b""],[""p"",""b""]]

Naming a Company,"You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:

Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
Otherwise, it is not a valid name.

Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
 
Example 1:

Input: ideas = [""coffee"",""donuts"",""time"",""toffee""]
Output: 6
Explanation: The following selections are valid:
- (""coffee"", ""donuts""): The company name created is ""doffee conuts"".
- (""donuts"", ""coffee""): The company name created is ""conuts doffee"".
- (""donuts"", ""time""): The company name created is ""tonuts dime"".
- (""donuts"", ""toffee""): The company name created is ""tonuts doffee"".
- (""time"", ""donuts""): The company name created is ""dime tonuts"".
- (""toffee"", ""donuts""): The company name created is ""doffee tonuts"".
Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.

The following are some examples of invalid selections:
- (""coffee"", ""time""): The name ""toffee"" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
- (""time"", ""toffee""): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
- (""coffee"", ""toffee""): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.

Note that the spectators are very picky. Hence:

They will book seats only if each member of their group can get a seat with row number less than or equal to maxRow. maxRow can vary from group to group.
In case there are multiple rows to choose from, the row with the smallest number is chosen. If there are multiple seats to choose in the same row, the seat with the smallest number is chosen.

Steps to Make Array Non-decreasing,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one step, remove all elements nums[i] where nums[i - 1] > nums[i] for all 0 < i < nums.length.
Return the number of steps performed until nums becomes a non-decreasing array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the steps performed:
- Step 1: [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11] becomes [5,4,4,7,6,11,11]
- Step 2: [5,4,4,7,6,11,11] becomes [5,4,7,11,11]
- Step 3: [5,4,7,11,11] becomes [5,7,11,11]
[5,7,11,11] is a non-decreasing array. Therefore, we return 3.

Apply Discount to Prices,"A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word can contain digits, lowercase letters, and the dollar sign '$'. A word represents a price if it is a sequence of digits preceded by a dollar sign.

For example, ""$100"", ""$23"", and ""$6"" represent prices while ""100"", ""$"", and ""$1e5"" do not.

You are given a string sentence representing a sentence and an integer discount. For each word representing a price, apply a discount of discount% on the price and update the word in the sentence. All updated prices should be represented with exactly two decimal places.
Return a string representing the modified sentence.
Note that all prices will contain at most 10 digits.
 
Example 1:

Input: sentence = ""there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop"", discount = 50
Output: ""there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop""
Explanation: 
The words which represent prices are ""$1"" and ""$2"". 
- A 50% discount on ""$1"" yields ""$0.50"", so ""$1"" is replaced by ""$0.50"".
- A 50% discount on ""$2"" yields ""$1"". Since we need to have exactly 2 decimal places after a price, we replace ""$2"" with ""$1.00"".

Example 2:

Input: sentence = ""1 2 $3 4 $5 $6 7 8$ $9 $10$"", discount = 100
Output: ""1 2 $0.00 4 $0.00 $0.00 7 8$ $0.00 $10$""
Explanation: 
Applying a 100% discount on any price will result in 0.
The words representing prices are ""$3"", ""$5"", ""$6"", and ""$9"".
Each of them is replaced by ""$0.00"".

 
Constraints:

1 <= sentence.length <= 105

Sum of Total Strength of Wizards,"As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array strength, where strength[i] denotes the strength of the ith wizard. For a contiguous group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a subarray of strength), the total strength is defined as the product of the following two values:

The strength of the weakest wizard in the group.
The total of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.

Return the sum of the total strengths of all contiguous groups of wizards. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: strength = [1,3,1,2]
Output: 44
Explanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:
- [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
- [3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3]) * sum([3]) = 3 * 3 = 9
- [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1

Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.
 
Example 1:


Input: parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = ""abacbe""
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions.

Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path,"You are given a 2D integer array grid of size m x n, where each cell contains a positive integer.
A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.
The product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.
Return the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in grid.
Note:

Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction.
Vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.

Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, ""346"" is replaced with ""13"" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.

Return s after all rounds have been completed.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""11111222223"", k = 3
Output: ""135""
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: ""111"", ""112"", ""222"", and ""23"".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""3"" + ""4"" + ""6"" + ""5"" = ""3465"" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into ""346"" and ""5"".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""13"" + ""5"" = ""135"" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return ""135"" as the answer.

Input: s = ""00000000"", k = 3
Output: ""000""
Explanation: 
We divide s into ""000"", ""000"", and ""00"".
Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
s becomes ""0"" + ""0"" + ""0"" = ""000"", whose length is equal to k, so we return ""000"".

There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.

Maximum Score of a Node Sequence,"There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array scores of length n where scores[i] denotes the score of node i. You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.
A node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:

There is an edge connecting every pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence.
No node appears more than once in the sequence.

The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.
Return the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of 4. If no such sequence exists, return -1.
 
Example 1:


Input: scores = [5,2,9,8,4], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]

Design an ATM Machine,"There is an ATM machine that stores banknotes of 5 denominations: 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 dollars. Initially the ATM is empty. The user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money.
When withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of larger values.

For example, if you want to withdraw $300 and there are 2 $50 banknotes, 1 $100 banknote, and 1 $200 banknote, then the machine will use the $100 and $200 banknotes.
However, if you try to withdraw $600 and there are 3 $200 banknotes and 1 $500 banknote, then the withdraw request will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the $500 banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining $100. Note that the machine is not allowed to use the $200 banknotes instead of the $500 banknote.

Implement the ATM class:

ATM() Initializes the ATM object.
void deposit(int[] banknotesCount) Deposits new banknotes in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500.
int[] withdraw(int amount) Returns an array of length 5 of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500, and update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing. Returns [-1] if it is not possible (do not withdraw any banknotes in this case).

Count Number of Texts,"Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The mapping of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.

In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i is the position of the letter in the key.

For example, to add the letter 's', Alice has to press '7' four times. Similarly, to add the letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.
Note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.

For example, when Alice sent the message ""bob"", Bob received the string ""2266622"".

Given a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens,"Alice is a caretaker of n gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array flowers of size n, where flowers[i] is the number of flowers already planted in the ith garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.
A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:

The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.
The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.

Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.
 
Example 1:

Input: flowers = [1,3,1,1], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1
Output: 14
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 2 flowers in the 0th garden
- 3 flowers in the 1st garden
- 1 flower in the 2nd garden
- 1 flower in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be [3,6,2,2]. She planted a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 7 flowers.
There is 1 garden that is complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 2.
Thus, the total beauty is 1 * 12 + 2 * 1 = 12 + 2 = 14.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 14.

Example 2:

Input: flowers = [2,4,5,3], newFlowers = 10, target = 5, full = 2, partial = 6
Output: 30
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 3 flowers in the 0th garden
- 0 flowers in the 1st garden
- 0 flowers in the 2nd garden
- 2 flowers in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be [5,4,5,5]. She planted a total of 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 5 flowers.
There are 3 gardens that are complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 4.
Thus, the total beauty is 3 * 2 + 4 * 6 = 6 + 24 = 30.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 30.

Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.

Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows.
The points are then calculated as follows:
	
The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive.
For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say Alice and Bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. If ak >= bk, then Alice takes k points. If ak < bk, then Bob takes k points.
However, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points.





For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points.


You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain.
Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. The sum of the values in bobArrows should equal numArrows.
If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return any one of them.
 
Example 1:


Input: numArrows = 9, aliceArrows = [1,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0]
Output: [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,1]
Explanation: The table above shows how the competition is scored. 
Bob earns a total point of 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 47.
It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 47 points.

Example 2:


Input: numArrows = 3, aliceArrows = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]

Count Collisions on a Road,"There are n cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from 0 to n - 1 from left to right and each car is present at a unique point.
You are given a 0-indexed string directions of length n. directions[i] can be either 'L', 'R', or 'S' denoting whether the ith car is moving towards the left, towards the right, or staying at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the same speed.
The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:

When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2.
When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.

After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.
Return the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.
 
Example 1:

Input: directions = ""RLRSLL""
Output: 5
Explanation:
The collisions that will happen on the road are:
- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.
Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5. 

Example 2:

Input: directions = ""LLRR""
Output: 0
Explanation:
No cars will collide with each other. Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 0.

Count Hills and Valleys in an Array,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].
Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.
Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,4,1,1,6,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill. 
At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley.
At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2.
At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill.
At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley. 
There are 3 hills and valleys so we return 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,6,5,5,4,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 1: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 1 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 2 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 3 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 5 and 1. Since 4 < 5 and 4 > 1, index 4 is neither a hill nor a valley.

Output: 100
Explanation: For target = 100, there are 2 occurrences at indices 1 and 4 which follow an occurrence of key.
No other integers follow an occurrence of key, so we return 100.

Example 2:

Return the minimum number of operations to reduce the sum of nums by at least half.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,19,8,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The initial sum of nums is equal to 5 + 19 + 8 + 1 = 33.
The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
Pick the number 19 and reduce it to 9.5.
Pick the number 9.5 and reduce it to 4.75.
Pick the number 8 and reduce it to 4.
The final array is [5, 4.75, 4, 1] with a total sum of 5 + 4.75 + 4 + 1 = 14.75. 
The sum of nums has been reduced by 33 - 14.75 = 18.25, which is at least half of the initial sum, 18.25 >= 33/2 = 16.5.
Overall, 3 operations were used so we return 3.
It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,8,20]
Output: 3
Explanation: The initial sum of nums is equal to 3 + 8 + 20 = 31.
The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
Pick the number 20 and reduce it to 10.
Pick the number 10 and reduce it to 5.
Pick the number 3 and reduce it to 1.5.
The final array is [1.5, 8, 5] with a total sum of 1.5 + 8 + 5 = 14.5.

You can add either pattern[0] or pattern[1] anywhere in text exactly once. Note that the character can be added even at the beginning or at the end of text.
Return the maximum number of times pattern can occur as a subsequence of the modified text.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 
Example 1:

Input: text = ""abdcdbc"", pattern = ""ac""
Output: 4
Explanation:
If we add pattern[0] = 'a' in between text[1] and text[2], we get ""abadcdbc"". Now, the number of times ""ac"" occurs as a subsequence is 4.
Some other strings which have 4 subsequences ""ac"" after adding a character to text are ""aabdcdbc"" and ""abdacdbc"".
However, strings such as ""abdcadbc"", ""abdccdbc"", and ""abdcdbcc"", although obtainable, have only 3 subsequences ""ac"" and are thus suboptimal.

Explanation: 
- (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = [12,3,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = [12,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = [12,7,6,2].
- (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = [12,7,6].

Minimum Time to Complete Trips,"You are given an array time where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip.
Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.
You are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.
 
Example 1:

Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.

Example 2:

Input: time = [2], totalTrips = 1

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""leetcode"", t = ""coats""
Output: 7
Explanation: 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in ""as"" onto s = ""leetcode"", forming s = ""leetcodeas"".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in ""leede"" onto t = ""coats"", forming t = ""coatsleede"".
""leetcodeas"" and ""coatsleede"" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.

Maximum AND Sum of Array,"You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer numSlots such that 2 * numSlots >= n. There are numSlots slots numbered from 1 to numSlots.
You have to place all n integers into the slots such that each slot contains at most two numbers. The AND sum of a given placement is the sum of the bitwise AND of every number with its respective slot number.

For example, the AND sum of placing the numbers [1, 3] into slot 1 and [4, 6] into slot 2 is equal to (1 AND 1) + (3 AND 1) + (4 AND 2) + (6 AND 2) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 4.

Return the maximum possible AND sum of nums given numSlots slots.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], numSlots = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: One possible placement is [1, 4] into slot 1, [2, 6] into slot 2, and [3, 5] into slot 3. 
This gives the maximum AND sum of (1 AND 1) + (4 AND 1) + (2 AND 2) + (6 AND 2) + (3 AND 3) + (5 AND 3) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9.

Example 2:

Output: 24
Explanation: One possible placement is [1, 1] into slot 1, [3] into slot 3, [4] into slot 4, [7] into slot 7, and [10] into slot 9.
This gives the maximum AND sum of (1 AND 1) + (1 AND 1) + (3 AND 3) + (4 AND 4) + (7 AND 7) + (10 AND 9) = 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 24.

Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans,"You are given an array of positive integers beans, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.
Remove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are not allowed to return it to any of the bags.
Return the minimum number of magic beans that you have to remove.
 
Example 1:

Input: beans = [4,1,6,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
- We remove 1 bean from the bag with only 1 bean.
  This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,6,5]
- Then we remove 2 beans from the bag with 6 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,5]
- Then we remove 1 bean from the bag with 5 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,4]
We removed a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
There are no other solutions that remove 4 beans or fewer.

Example 2:

Input: beans = [2,10,3,2]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- We remove 2 beans from one of the bags with 2 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,2]
- Then we remove 2 beans from the other bag with 2 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,0]
- Then we remove 3 beans from the bag with 3 beans. 
  This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,0,0]

Minimum Operations to Make the Array Alternating,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of n positive integers.
The array nums is called alternating if:

nums[i - 2] == nums[i], where 2 <= i <= n - 1.
nums[i - 1] != nums[i], where 1 <= i <= n - 1.

In one operation, you can choose an index i and change nums[i] into any positive integer.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array alternating.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,2,4,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [3,1,3,1,3,1].
The number of operations required in this case is 3.
It can be proven that it is not possible to make the array alternating in less than 3 operations. 

Example 2:

Explanation:
One way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [1,2,1,2,1].
The number of operations required in this case is 2.

Count Operations to Obtain Zero,"You are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.
In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.

For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.

Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 1. Since num1 == 0, we do not need to perform any further operations.
So the total number of operations required is 3.

Example 2:

Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1 and get num1 = 10 - 10 = 0.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 10. Since num1 == 0, we are done.
So the total number of operations required is 1.

Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods,"You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents a sequence of train cars. s[i] = '0' denotes that the ith car does not contain illegal goods and s[i] = '1' denotes that the ith car does contain illegal goods.
As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations any number of times:

Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.

Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.
Note that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""1100101""
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.
This obtains a total time of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. 

An alternative way is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This also obtains a total time of 2 + 3 = 5.

- remove a car from the left end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This obtains a total time of 3.

Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to

Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]

Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.

Find Substring With Given Hash Value,"The hash of a 0-indexed string s of length k, given integers p and m, is computed using the following function:

hash(s, p, m) = (val(s[0]) * p0 + val(s[1]) * p1 + ... + val(s[k-1]) * pk-1) mod m.

Where val(s[i]) represents the index of s[i] in the alphabet from val('a') = 1 to val('z') = 26.
You are given a string s and the integers power, modulo, k, and hashValue. Return sub, the first substring of s of length k such that hash(sub, power, modulo) == hashValue.
The test cases will be generated such that an answer always exists.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""leetcode"", power = 7, modulo = 20, k = 2, hashValue = 0
Output: ""ee""
Explanation: The hash of ""ee"" can be computed to be hash(""ee"", 7, 20) = (5 * 1 + 5 * 7) mod 20 = 40 mod 20 = 0. 
""ee"" is the first substring of length 2 with hashValue 0. Hence, we return ""ee"".

Example 2:

Input: s = ""fbxzaad"", power = 31, modulo = 100, k = 3, hashValue = 32
Output: ""fbx""
Explanation: The hash of ""fbx"" can be computed to be hash(""fbx"", 31, 100) = (6 * 1 + 2 * 31 + 24 * 312) mod 100 = 23132 mod 100 = 32. 
The hash of ""bxz"" can be computed to be hash(""bxz"", 31, 100) = (2 * 1 + 24 * 31 + 26 * 312) mod 100 = 25732 mod 100 = 32. 
""fbx"" is the first substring of length 3 with hashValue 32. Hence, we return ""fbx"".
Note that ""bxz"" also has a hash of 32 but it appears later than ""fbx"".

Maximum Good People Based on Statements,"There are two types of persons:

The good person: The person who always tells the truth.
The bad person: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array statements of size n x n that represents the statements made by n people about each other. More specifically, statements[i][j] could be one of the following:

0 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a bad person.
1 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a good person.
2 represents that no statement is made by person i about person j.

Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that statements[i][i] = 2 for all 0 <= i < n.
Return the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.
 
Example 1:


Input: statements = [[2,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.
- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.
Let's take person 2 as the key.
- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.
    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.
    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.
        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.
    - Following that person 2 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group.
- Assuming that person 2 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, and since person 2 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad as explained before.
            - Following that person 2 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group.
        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.
            - Since person 1 is a good person, person 0 is also a good person.
            - Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group.
We can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.
Note that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.

Example 2:


Input: statements = [[2,0],[0,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is bad.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is bad.
Let's take person 0 as the key.
- Assuming that person 0 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, person 1 is a bad person and was lying.
    - Following that person 0 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group.
- Assuming that person 0 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, and since person 0 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad.
            - Following that person 0 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group.
        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.
            - Following that person 0 is bad and lied, there will be only one good person in the group.
We can see that at most, one person is good in the best case, so we return 1.

You should return the array of nums such that the the array follows the given conditions:

Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10,8]
Explanation: 
- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.
- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.

Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.
You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time,"A generic microwave supports cooking times for:

at least 1 second.
at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,

You push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds.
You push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds.
You push 8 0 9 0. It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds.
You push 8 1 3 0. It is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds.

You are given integers startAt, moveCost, pushCost, and targetSeconds. Initially, your finger is on the digit startAt. Moving the finger above any specific digit costs moveCost units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs pushCost units of fatigue.
There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetSeconds seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.
Return the minimum cost to set targetSeconds seconds of cooking time.
Remember that one minute consists of 60 seconds.
 
Example 1:


Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.

Example 2:


Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.
The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6

The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
 
Example 1:

Explanation:
The first 3 characters ""abc"" form the first group.
The next 3 characters ""def"" form the second group.
The last 3 characters ""ghi"" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.

Input: s = ""abcdefghij"", k = 3, fill = ""x""
Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi"",""jxx""]
Explanation:
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
Thus, the 4 groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi"", and ""jxx"".

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters only.
1 <= k <= 100
fill is a lowercase English letter.

Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom,"You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of length n each:

plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.
growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.

From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.
Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.
 
Example 1:


Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

Example 2:


Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

Example 3:

Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.

Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter,"You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings startWords and targetWords. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.
For each string in targetWords, check if it is possible to choose a string from startWords and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that from targetWords.
The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:

Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.

	
For example, if the string is ""abc"", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be ""abcd"".


Rearrange the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.
	
For example, ""abcd"" can be rearranged to ""acbd"", ""bacd"", ""cbda"", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to ""abcd"" itself.



Return the number of strings in targetWords that can be obtained by performing the operations on any string of startWords.
Note that you will only be verifying if the string in targetWords can be obtained from a string in startWords by performing the operations. The strings in startWords do not actually change during this process.
 
Example 1:

Input: startWords = [""ant"",""act"",""tack""], targetWords = [""tack"",""act"",""acti""]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""tack"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'k' to it, and rearrange ""actk"" to ""tack"".
- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1] = ""act"".
  Note that ""act"" does exist in startWords, but we must append one letter to the string before rearranging it.
- In order to form targetWords[2] = ""acti"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'i' to it, and rearrange ""acti"" to ""acti"" itself.

Example 2:

Input: startWords = [""ab"",""a""], targetWords = [""abc"",""abcd""]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""abc"", we use startWords[0] = ""ab"", add 'c' to it, and rearrange it to ""abc"".
- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1] = ""abcd"".

Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II,"A swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them.
A circular array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.
Given a binary circular array nums, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
[1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1]

Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor,"Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. You are given a 0-indexed string corridor of length n consisting of letters 'S' and 'P' where each 'S' represents a seat and each 'P' represents a plant.
One room divider has already been installed to the left of index 0, and another to the right of index n - 1. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices i - 1 and i (1 <= i <= n - 1), at most one divider can be installed.
Divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has exactly two seats with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to perform the division. Two ways are different if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.
Return the number of ways to divide the corridor. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. If there is no way, return 0.
 
Example 1:


Input: corridor = ""SSPPSPS""

Explanation: There are 3 different ways to divide the corridor.
The black bars in the above image indicate the two room dividers already installed.
Note that in each of the ways, each section has exactly two seats.

Example 2:


Input: corridor = ""PPSPSP""
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only 1 way to divide the corridor, by not installing any additional dividers.
Installing any would create some section that does not have exactly two seats.

Example 3:


Input: corridor = ""S""
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to divide the corridor because there will always be a section that does not have exactly two seats.

K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range,"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:

0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.
You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.
You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:

Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).
Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).

Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,0,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,5], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
The ranks of these items are:
- (0,1) with distance 1
- (1,1) with distance 2
- (2,1) with distance 3
- (2,2) with distance 4
Thus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).

Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3], k = 2
Output: [[2,1],[1,2]]
Explanation: You start at (2,3).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
- (1,1) with distance 3
- (0,1) with distance 4
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).

Example 3:


Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[2,1],[2,0]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). 
The ranks of these items are: 
- (2,1) with distance 5
- (2,0) with distance 6
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0).

Count the Hidden Sequences,"You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].
You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.

For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

	
[3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.
[5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.
[1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.

Minimum Cost of Buying Candies With Discount,"A shop is selling candies at a discount. For every two candies sold, the shop gives a third candy for free.
The customer can choose any candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the minimum cost of the two candies bought.

For example, if there are 4 candies with costs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the customer buys candies with costs 2 and 3, they can take the candy with cost 1 for free, but not the candy with cost 4.

Given a 0-indexed integer array cost, where cost[i] denotes the cost of the ith candy, return the minimum cost of buying all the candies.
 
Example 1:

Input: cost = [1,2,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the only way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.

Example 2:

Input: cost = [6,5,7,9,2,2]
Output: 23
Explanation: The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:
- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.

Example 3:

Input: cost = [5,5]

Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting,"A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of n employees, waiting to be invited. They have arranged for a large circular table, capable of seating any number of employees.
The employees are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee has a favorite person and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is not themself.
Given a 0-indexed integer array favorite, where favorite[i] denotes the favorite person of the ith employee, return the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting.
 
Example 1:


Input: favorite = [2,2,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2, and seat them at the round table.
All employees cannot be invited because employee 2 cannot sit beside employees 0, 1, and 3, simultaneously.
Note that the company can also invite employees 1, 2, and 3, and give them their desired seats.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3. 

Example 2:

Input: favorite = [1,2,0]

Explanation: 
Each employee is the favorite person of at least one other employee, and the only way the company can invite them is if they invite every employee.
The seating arrangement will be the same as that in the figure given in example 1:
- Employee 0 will sit between employees 2 and 1.
- Employee 1 will sit between employees 0 and 2.
- Employee 2 will sit between employees 1 and 0.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3.

Return true if all asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
Output: true
Explanation: One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67

Example 2:

Input: mass = 5, asteroids = [4,9,23,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The planet cannot ever gain enough mass to destroy the asteroid with a mass of 23.
After the planet destroys the other asteroids, it will have a mass of 5 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 22.
This is less than 23, so a collision would not destroy the last asteroid.

Number of Laser Beams in a Bank,"Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.
There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

lower[i] = arr[i] - k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n
higher[i] = arr[i] + k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.
Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.
Note: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.

Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid,"There is an n x n grid, with the top-left cell at (0, 0) and the bottom-right cell at (n - 1, n - 1). You are given the integer n and an integer array startPos where startPos = [startrow, startcol] indicates that a robot is initially at cell (startrow, startcol).
You are also given a 0-indexed string s of length m where s[i] is the ith instruction for the robot: 'L' (move left), 'R' (move right), 'U' (move up), and 'D' (move down).
The robot can begin executing from any ith instruction in s. It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of s but it stops if either of these conditions is met:

The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the number of instructions the robot can execute if the robot begins executing from the ith instruction in s.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 3, startPos = [0,1], s = ""RRDDLU""
Output: [1,5,4,3,1,0]
Explanation: Starting from startPos and beginning execution from the ith instruction:
- 0th: ""RRDDLU"". Only one instruction ""R"" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 1st:  ""RDDLU"". All five instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 1).

Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List,"In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.

The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.
Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
 
Example 1:


Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 

Example 2:


Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 

Example 3:


Input: head = [1,100000]

If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.

Return the capitalized title.
 
Example 1:

Input: title = ""capiTalIze tHe titLe""
Output: ""Capitalize The Title""
Explanation:
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Example 2:

Input: title = ""First leTTeR of EACH Word""
Output: ""First Letter of Each Word""
Explanation:
The word ""of"" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Example 3:

Input: title = ""i lOve leetcode""
Output: ""i Love Leetcode""
Explanation:
The word ""i"" has length 1, so it is lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing,"You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.
The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.

For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:

	
arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)


However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).

In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

You are also given an integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most k steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.
Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.
 
Example 1:

Explanation: 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits

Watering Plants II,"Alice and Bob want to water n plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i.
Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:

Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.
 
Example 1:

Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Example 2:

Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

The first character of the ith pair denotes the ith ring's color ('R', 'G', 'B').
The second character of the ith pair denotes the rod that the ith ring is placed on ('0' to '9').

For example, ""R3G2B1"" describes n == 3 rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled 1.
Return the number of rods that have all three colors of rings on them.
 
Example 1:


Input: rings = ""B0B6G0R6R0R6G9""

Explanation: 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 3 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 6 holds 3 rings, but it only has red and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a green ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.

Abbreviating the Product of a Range,"You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:

Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.

	
For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.


Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
	
For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.


Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"".
	
For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as ""12345...89876e5"".



Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
 
Example 1:

Input: left = 1, right = 4
Output: ""24e0""
Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.
There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"".
Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.
Thus, the final representation is ""24e0"".

Example 2:

Input: left = 2, right = 11
Output: ""399168e2""
Explanation: The product is 39916800.
There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"".
The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.
Hence, the abbreviated product is ""399168e2"".

We change s[0] and s[4] to '(' while leaving s[2] and s[5] unchanged to make s valid.
Example 2:

Input: s = ""()()"", locked = ""0000""
Output: true
Explanation: We do not need to make any changes because s is already valid.

Example 3:

Input: s = "")"", locked = ""0""

A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.
Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.
The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.
Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 6, meetings = [[1,2,5],[2,3,8],[1,5,10]], firstPerson = 1

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, meetings = [[3,1,3],[1,2,2],[0,3,3]], firstPerson = 3
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.
At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.
Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.

Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array,"You are given a 0-indexed array of distinct integers nums.
There is an element in nums that has the lowest value and an element that has the highest value. We call them the minimum and maximum respectively. Your goal is to remove both these elements from the array.
A deletion is defined as either removing an element from the front of the array or removing an element from the back of the array.
Return the minimum number of deletions it would take to remove both the minimum and maximum element from the array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[1], which is -4.
The maximum element in the array is nums[2], which is 19.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.
This results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

Example 3:

K Radius Subarray Averages,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.
The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.
Build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.
The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.

For example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation:
- avg[0], avg[1], and avg[2] are -1 because there are less than k elements before each index.
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.
  Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.
- For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.
- For the subarray centered at index 5, avg[5] = (3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 6) / 7 = 4.
- avg[6], avg[7], and avg[8] are -1 because there are less than k elements after each index.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [100000], k = 0
Output: [100000]
Explanation:
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 0 with radius 0 is: 100000.
  avg[0] = 100000 / 1 = 100000.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [8], k = 100000

Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker,"A scenic location is represented by its name and attractiveness score, where name is a unique string among all locations and score is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the lexicographically smaller name is better.
You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

Adding scenic locations, one at a time.
Querying the ith best location of all locations already added, where i is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
	
For example, when the system is queried for the 4th time, it returns the 4th best location of all locations already added.



Note that the test data are generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system.
Implement the SORTracker class:

SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system.
void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system.

Explanation:
The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.

The ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:

There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.

More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].
Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.
 
Example 1:

Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2

Explanation:
On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].
On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.

Example 2:

Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0

Decode the Slanted Ciphertext,"A string originalText is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string encodedText with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows rows.
originalText is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.

The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of originalText. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with ' '. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in originalText.
encodedText is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.

The characters in the blue cells are appended first to encodedText, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.
For example, if originalText = ""cipher"" and rows = 3, then we encode it in the following manner:

The blue arrows depict how originalText is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which encodedText is formed. In the above example, encodedText = ""ch ie pr"".

Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.

Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land,"A farmer has a rectangular grid of land with m rows and n columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either fertile (represented by a 1) or barren (represented by a 0). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.
A pyramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:

The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
The apex of a pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid. The height of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r).

An inverse pyramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:

The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
The apex of an inverse pyramid is the bottommost cell of the inverse pyramid. The height of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r - h + 1 <= i <= r and c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i).

Some examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.

All possible substrings are: ""a"", ""ab"", ""aba"", ""b"", ""ba"", and ""a"".
- ""b"" has 0 vowels in it
- ""a"", ""ab"", ""ba"", and ""a"" have 1 vowel each
- ""aba"" has 2 vowels in it
Hence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. 

Example 2:

Check if an Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings,"An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:

Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.
Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.

For example, one way to encode an original string ""abcdefghijklmnop"" might be:

Split it as a sequence: [""ab"", ""cdefghijklmn"", ""o"", ""p""].
Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [""ab"", ""12"", ""1"", ""p""].
Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: ""ab121p"".

Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.
Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""internationalization"", s2 = ""i18n""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""internationalization"" was the original string.
- ""internationalization"" 
  -> Split:       [""internationalization""]
  -> Do not replace any element
  -> Concatenate:  ""internationalization"", which is s1.
- ""internationalization""
  -> Split:       [""i"", ""nternationalizatio"", ""n""]
  -> Replace:     [""i"", ""18"",                 ""n""]
  -> Concatenate:  ""i18n"", which is s2

Example 2:

Input: s1 = ""l123e"", s2 = ""44""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""leetcode"" was the original string.
- ""leetcode"" 
  -> Split:      [""l"", ""e"", ""et"", ""cod"", ""e""]
  -> Replace:    [""l"", ""1"", ""2"",  ""3"",   ""e""]
  -> Concatenate: ""l123e"", which is s1.
- ""leetcode"" 
  -> Split:      [""leet"", ""code""]
  -> Replace:    [""4"",    ""4""]
  -> Concatenate: ""44"", which is s2.

Example 3:

Input: s1 = ""a5b"", s2 = ""c5b""
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible.
- The original string encoded as s1 must start with the letter 'a'.
- The original string encoded as s2 must start with the letter 'c'.

Minimum Operations to Convert Number,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing distinct numbers, an integer start, and an integer goal. There is an integer x that is initially set to start, and you want to perform operations on x such that it is converted to goal. You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number x:
If 0 <= x <= 1000, then for any index i in the array (0 <= i < nums.length), you can set x to any of the following:

x + nums[i]
x - nums[i]
x ^ nums[i] (bitwise-XOR)

Note that you can use each nums[i] any number of times in any order. Operations that set x to be out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000 are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert x = start into goal, and -1 if it is not possible.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,4,12], start = 2, goal = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: We can go from 2 → 14 → 12 with the following 2 operations.
- 2 + 12 = 14
- 14 - 2 = 12

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,5,7], start = 0, goal = -4
Output: 2
Explanation: We can go from 0 → 3 → -4 with the following 2 operations. 
- 0 + 3 = 3
- 3 - 7 = -4
Note that the last operation sets x out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000, which is valid.

Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points,"A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.
A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.
A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.
Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.
Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].
 
Example 1:


Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].

Example 2:


Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

Example 3:


Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.
Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.
 
Example 1:

Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1

Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. 
  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[3,4],[4,5]], time = 3, change = 5
Output: 13
Explanation:
The figure on the left shows the given graph.
The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.
The time taken is:
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.

The red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
- Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.      

Example 2:


Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,2]], time = 3, change = 2

Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard,"There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard.
When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.

A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).
A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).

You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.
Return the number of valid move combinations​​​​​.
Notes:

No two pieces will start in the same square.
You may choose the square a piece is already on as its destination.

Stone Game IX,"Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of n stones, and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array stones, where stones[i] is the value of the ith stone.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from stones. The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by 3. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).
Assuming both players play optimally, return true if Alice wins and false if Bob wins.
 
Example 1:

Input: stones = [2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The game will be played as follows:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove either stone.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the remaining stone. 
The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by 3. Therefore, Bob loses and Alice wins the game.

Example 2:

Input: stones = [2]
Output: false
Explanation: Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. 
Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game.

Example 3:

Input: stones = [5,1,2,4,3]
Output: false
Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4.
- Turn 3: Alices removes the fourth stone with value 4. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
- Turn 4: Bob removes the third stone with value 2. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 10.
- Turn 5: Alice removes the first stone with value 5. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 15.

You are given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates there is a message channel between servers ui and vi, and they can pass any number of messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n.
All servers are connected, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.
The server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.
At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:

If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server.
Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.

The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
Return the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.
 
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], patience = [0,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
At (the beginning of) second 0,
- Data server 1 sends its message (denoted 1A) to the master server.
- Data server 2 sends its message (denoted 2A) to the master server.

At second 1,
- Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.
- Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.
- Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).

At second 2,
- The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1.
- Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back.
- Server 2 resends the message (denoted 2C).
...
At second 4,
- The reply 2A arrives at server 2. No more resending will occur from server 2.
...
At second 7, reply 2D arrives at server 2.

Starting from the beginning of the second 8, there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
This is the time when the network becomes idle.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]], patience = [0,10,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: Data servers 1 and 2 receive a reply back at the beginning of second 2.
From the beginning of the second 3, the network becomes idle.

Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color,"There are n pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by 'A' or by 'B'. You are given a string colors of length n where colors[i] is the color of the ith piece.
Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves first.

Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'A' if both its neighbors are also colored 'A'. She is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'B'.
Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'B' if both its neighbors are also colored 'B'. He is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'A'.
Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins, or return false if Bob wins.
 
Example 1:

Input: colors = ""AAABABB""
Output: true
Explanation:
AAABABB -> AABABB
Alice moves first.
She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

Now it's Bob's turn.
Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.
Thus, Alice wins, so return true.

Example 2:

Input: colors = ""AA""
Output: false
Explanation:
Alice has her turn first.
There are only two 'A's and both are on the edge of the line, so she cannot move on her turn.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.

Example 3:

Input: colors = ""ABBBBBBBAAA""
Output: false
Explanation:
ABBBBBBBAAA -> ABBBBBBBAA
Alice moves first.
Her only option is to remove the second to last 'A' from the right.

ABBBBBBBAA -> ABBBBBBAA
Next is Bob's turn.
He has many options for which 'B' piece to remove. He can pick any.

On Alice's second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.

The Score of Students Solving Math Expression,"You are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2). This expression was given to n elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this order of operations:

Compute multiplication, reading from left to right; Then,
Compute addition, reading from left to right.

You are given an integer array answers of length n, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the answers, by following these rules:

If an answer equals the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded 5 points;
Otherwise, if the answer could be interpreted as if the student applied the operators in the wrong order but had correct arithmetic, this student will be rewarded 2 points;
Otherwise, this student will be rewarded 0 points.

Return the sum of the points of the students.
 
Example 1:


Input: s = ""7+3*1*2"", answers = [20,13,42]
Output: 7
Explanation: As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,13,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [20,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""3+5*2"", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
Output: 19
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""6+0*1"", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.

For example, if binary = ""001"", then all the good subsequences are [""0"", ""0"", ""1""], so the unique good subsequences are ""0"" and ""1"". Note that subsequences ""00"", ""01"", and ""001"" are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return the number of unique good subsequences of binary. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Operations on Tree,"You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of the ith node. The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.
The data structure should support the following functions:

Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:
	
The node is unlocked,
It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and
It does not have any locked ancestors.



Implement the LockingTree class:

LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.
lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.
unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked.
upgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.

Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements,"You are given a positive integer p. Consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:

Choose two elements x and y from nums.
Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.

For example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.
Find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 109 + 7.
Note: The answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done.
 
Example 1:

Input: p = 1

There is only one element, so the product equals that element.

Example 2:

Input: p = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: nums = [01, 10, 11].
Any swap would either make the product 0 or stay the same.
Thus, the array product of 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 is already minimized.

The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.

For example, folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:

	
/a
/a/x
/a/x/y
/a/z
/b
/b/x
/b/x/y
/b/z


However, if the file structure also included the path ""/b/w"", then the folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" would not be identical. Note that ""/a/x"" and ""/b/x"" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
 
Example 1:


Input: paths = [[""a""],[""c""],[""d""],[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""b""],[""d"",""a""]]
Output: [[""d""],[""d"",""a""]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders ""/a"" and ""/c"" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named ""b"".

Example 2:


Input: paths = [[""a""],[""c""],[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""b""],[""a"",""b"",""x""],[""a"",""b"",""x"",""y""],[""w""],[""w"",""y""]]
Output: [[""c""],[""c"",""b""],[""a""],[""a"",""b""]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
Folders ""/a/b/x"" and ""/w"" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named ""y"".
Note that folders ""/a"" and ""/c"" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.

Example 3:


Input: paths = [[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""d""],[""c""],[""a""]]
Output: [[""c""],[""c"",""d""],[""a""],[""a"",""b""]]
Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.

 
Constraints:

1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= paths[i].length <= 500
1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10
1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 105
path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
No two paths lead to the same folder.
For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.

Maximum Compatibility Score Sum,"There is a survey that consists of n questions where each question's answer is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).
The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors numbered from 0 to m - 1. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array students where students[i] is an integer array that contains the answers of the ith student (0-indexed). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array mentors where mentors[j] is an integer array that contains the answers of the jth mentor (0-indexed).
Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one student assigned to them. The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

For example, if the student's answers were [1, 0, 1] and the mentor's answers were [0, 0, 1], then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize the sum of the compatibility scores.
Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.
 
Example 1:

Input: students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 8
Explanation: We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

Example 2:

Input: students = [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]], mentors = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.

 
Constraints:

m == students.length == mentors.length

Largest Number After Mutating Substring,"You are given a string num, which represents a large integer. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array change of length 10 that maps each digit 0-9 to another digit. More formally, digit d maps to digit change[d].
You may choose to mutate a single substring of num. To mutate a substring, replace each digit num[i] with the digit it maps to in change (i.e. replace num[i] with change[num[i]]).
Return a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = ""132"", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]
Output: ""832""
Explanation: Replace the substring ""1"":
- 1 maps to change[1] = 8.
Thus, ""132"" becomes ""832"".
""832"" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.

Example 2:

Input: num = ""021"", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]
Output: ""934""
Explanation: Replace the substring ""021"":
- 0 maps to change[0] = 9.
- 2 maps to change[2] = 3.
- 1 maps to change[1] = 4.
Thus, ""021"" becomes ""934"".
""934"" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.

Example 3:

Input: num = ""5"", change = [1,4,7,5,3,2,5,6,9,4]

Sum of Digits of String After Convert,"You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k. Your task is to convert the string into an integer by a special process, and then transform it by summing its digits repeatedly k times. More specifically, perform the following steps:

Convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e. replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26).
Transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits.
Repeat the transform operation (step 2) k times in total.

For example, if s = ""zbax"" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

Convert: ""zbax"" ➝ ""(26)(2)(1)(24)"" ➝ ""262124"" ➝ 262124
Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8

Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""iiii"", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation:
The operations are as follows:
- Convert: ""iiii"" ➝ ""(9)(9)(9)(9)"" ➝ ""9999"" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
Thus the resulting integer is 36.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""leetcode"", k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
The operations are as follows:
- Convert: ""leetcode"" ➝ ""(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)"" ➝ ""12552031545"" ➝ 12552031545
- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
Thus the resulting integer is 6.

The genetic difference between two genetic values is defined as the bitwise-XOR of their values. You are given the integer array parents, where parents[i] is the parent for node i. If node x is the root of the tree, then parents[x] == -1.
You are also given the array queries where queries[i] = [nodei, vali]. For each query i, find the maximum genetic difference between vali and pi, where pi is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between nodei and the root (including nodei and the root). More formally, you want to maximize vali XOR pi.
Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:


Input: parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]

Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
- [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates (r, c) will add points[r][c] to your score.
However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows r and r + 1 (where 0 <= r < m - 1), picking cells at coordinates (r, c1) and (r + 1, c2) will subtract abs(c1 - c2) from your score.
Return the maximum number of points you can achieve.
abs(x) is defined as:

Explanation:
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2 from your score.

Describe the Painting,"There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.
The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.

For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.

For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.
You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.

For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:

	
[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.

There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.
Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a 0-indexed integer array passingFees of length n where passingFees[j] is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city j.
In the beginning, you are at city 0 and want to reach city n - 1 in maxTime minutes or less. The cost of your journey is the summation of passing fees for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (including the source and destination cities).
Given maxTime, edges, and passingFees, return the minimum cost to complete your journey, or -1 if you cannot complete it within maxTime minutes.

Sum Game,"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
You are given a string num of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:

Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.
Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.
For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.

For example, if the game ended with num = ""243801"", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = ""243803"", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.
 
Example 1:

The Number of Full Rounds You Have Played,"You are participating in an online chess tournament. There is a chess round that starts every 15 minutes. The first round of the day starts at 00:00, and after every 15 minutes, a new round starts.

For example, the second round starts at 00:15, the fourth round starts at 00:45, and the seventh round starts at 01:30.

You are given two strings loginTime and logoutTime where:

loginTime is the time you will login to the game, and
logoutTime is the time you will logout from the game.

If logoutTime is earlier than loginTime, this means you have played from loginTime to midnight and from midnight to logoutTime.
Return the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament.
Note: All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at 00:00 and the last round of the day starts at 23:45.
 
Example 1:

Input: loginTime = ""09:31"", logoutTime = ""10:14""
Output: 1
Explanation: You played one full round from 09:45 to 10:00.
You did not play the full round from 09:30 to 09:45 because you logged in at 09:31 after it began.
You did not play the full round from 10:00 to 10:15 because you logged out at 10:14 before it ended.

Example 2:

Input: loginTime = ""21:30"", logoutTime = ""03:00""
Output: 22
Explanation: You played 10 full rounds from 21:30 to 00:00 and 12 full rounds from 00:00 to 03:00.
10 + 12 = 22.

Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors,"You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.
You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.

Example 2:

Input: n = 100
Output: 14
Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine f.

The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete,"There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).
The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Player 1 competes against player 7.
Player 2 competes against player 6.
Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.



After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.
Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
Third round: 2, 3, 4
One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Third round: 1, 2, 4
Fourth round: 2, 4

Example 2:

Maximum Number of Removable Characters,"You are given two strings s and p where p is a subsequence of s. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array removable containing a subset of indices of s (s is also 0-indexed).
You want to choose an integer k (0 <= k <= removable.length) such that, after removing k characters from s using the first k indices in removable, p is still a subsequence of s. More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.
Return the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcacb"", p = ""ab"", removable = [3,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, ""abcacb"" becomes ""accb"".
""ab"" is a subsequence of ""accb"".
If we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, ""abcacb"" becomes ""ccb"", and ""ab"" is no longer a subsequence.
Hence, the maximum k is 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abcbddddd"", p = ""abcd"", removable = [3,2,1,4,5,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: After removing the character at index 3, ""abcbddddd"" becomes ""abcddddd"".
""abcd"" is a subsequence of ""abcddddd"".

Example 3:

Input: s = ""abcab"", p = ""abc"", removable = [0,1,2,3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: If you remove the first index in the array removable, ""abc"" is no longer a subsequence.

 
Constraints:

1 <= p.length <= s.length <= 105

Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet,"A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.
To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].

	
For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].



Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]. Update the last triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.

Example 2:

Input: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to have [3,2,5] as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.

Example 3:

Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and third triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the third triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [2,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]].

Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.
The system should support the following functions:

Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.

Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging,"You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.
The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.
You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal,"Given an integer array nums, your goal is to make all elements in nums equal. To complete one operation, follow these steps:

Find the largest value in nums. Let its index be i (0-indexed) and its value be largest. If there are multiple elements with the largest value, pick the smallest i.
Find the next largest value in nums strictly smaller than largest. Let its value be nextLargest.
Reduce nums[i] to nextLargest.

Return the number of operations to make all elements in nums equal.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: It takes 3 operations to make all elements in nums equal:
1. largest = 5 at index 0. nextLargest = 3. Reduce nums[0] to 3. nums = [3,1,3].
2. largest = 3 at index 0. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[0] to 1. nums = [1,1,3].
3. largest = 3 at index 2. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[2] to 1. nums = [1,1,1].

Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time,"You are given an integer hoursBefore, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.
After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: dist = [1,3,2], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) + (2/4) = 2.5 hours.
You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.
Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.

Example 2:

Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.

Process Tasks Using Servers,"You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays servers and tasks of lengths n​​​​​​ and m​​​​​​ respectively. servers[i] is the weight of the i​​​​​​th​​​​ server, and tasks[j] is the time needed to process the j​​​​​​th​​​​ task in seconds.
Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.
At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.
If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.
A server that is assigned task j at second t will be free again at second t + tasks[j].

Number of Different Subsequences GCDs,"You are given an array nums that consists of positive integers.
The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.

For example, the GCD of the sequence [4,6,16] is 2.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].

Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of nums.

Minimum Absolute Sum Difference,"You are given two positive integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both of length n.
The absolute sum difference of arrays nums1 and nums2 is defined as the sum of |nums1[i] - nums2[i]| for each 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).
You can replace at most one element of nums1 with any other element in nums1 to minimize the absolute sum difference.
Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array nums1. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
|x| is defined as:

x if x >= 0, or
-x if x < 0.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].
Both will yield an absolute sum difference of |1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an 
absolute sum difference of 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]
Output: 20
Explanation: Replace the first element with the second: [1,10,4,4,2,7] => [10,10,4,4,2,7].

Finding the Users Active Minutes,"You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.
Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.
The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.
You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.
Return the array answer as described above.
 
Example 1:

Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.

Example 2:

Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.
Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.

Number of Orders in the Backlog,"You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:

0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
1 if it is a batch of sell orders.

Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.
There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.

Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:


Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

Example 2:


Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire timeToLive seconds after the currentTime. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire timeToLive seconds after the (potentially different) currentTime.
Implement the AuthenticationManager class:

AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) constructs the AuthenticationManager and sets the timeToLive.
generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) generates a new token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds.
renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) renews the unexpired token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given tokenId, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.
countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.

Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t (renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other actions.

Car Fleet II,"There are n cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array cars of length n, where cars[i] = [positioni, speedi] represents:

positioni is the distance between the ith car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that positioni < positioni+1.
speedi is the initial speed of the ith car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet.
Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the time, in seconds, at which the ith car collides with the next car, or -1 if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answers are accepted.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s alternating.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""0100""
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be ""0101"", which is alternating.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""10""
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already alternating.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""1111""
Output: 2
Explanation: You need two operations to reach ""0101"" or ""1010"".

+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 

 
For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.
Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+

Closest Subsequence Sum,"You are given an integer array nums and an integer goal.
You want to choose a subsequence of nums such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to goal. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is sum, then you want to minimize the absolute difference abs(sum - goal).
Return the minimum possible value of abs(sum - goal).
Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.

Largest Merge Of Two Strings,"You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:

If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.

	
For example, if word1 = ""abc"" and merge = ""dv"", then after choosing this operation, word1 = ""bc"" and merge = ""dva"".


If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.
	
For example, if word2 = ""abc"" and merge = """", then after choosing this operation, word2 = ""bc"" and merge = ""a"".



Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.
A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, ""abcd"" is lexicographically larger than ""abcc"" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
 
Example 1:

Input: word1 = ""cabaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
Output: ""cbcabaaaaa""
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = ""c"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cb"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""caaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cbc"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""aaa""
- Take from word1: merge = ""cbca"", word1 = ""baa"", word2 = ""aaa""
- Take from word1: merge = ""cbcab"", word1 = ""aa"", word2 = ""aaa""
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.

Example 2:

The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.
 
Example 1:

Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)

You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:

The height of each cell must be non-negative.
If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.

Tree of Coprimes,"There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node 0.
To represent this tree, you are given an integer array nums and a 2D array edges. Each nums[i] represents the ith node's value, and each edges[j] = [uj, vj] represents an edge between nodes uj and vj in the tree.
Two values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
An ancestor of a node i is any other node on the shortest path from node i to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.
Return an array ans of size n, where ans[i] is the closest ancestor to node i such that nums[i] and nums[ans[i]] are coprime, or -1 if there is no such ancestor.
 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]

Explanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.
- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.
- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).
- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's
  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.
- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its

Return true if you can do this task, and false otherwise.
Note that the subarrays are disjoint if and only if there is no index k such that nums[k] belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: groups = [[1,-1,-1],[3,-2,0]], nums = [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: You can choose the 0th subarray as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0] and the 1st one as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0].
These subarrays are disjoint as they share no common nums[k] element.

Example 2:

So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]
Output: 3.25000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.

Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch,"The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.
 
Example 1:

Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0 
Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].

The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.

 
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

A subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,4], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2] and [1,4].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (4-1) = 4.
Note that [1,1] and [2,4] would result in a smaller sum, but the first subset contains 2 equal elements.

Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary,"You are given an integer array nums of even length n and an integer limit. In one move, you can replace any integer from nums with another integer between 1 and limit, inclusive.
The array nums is complementary if for all indices i (0-indexed), nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals the same number. For example, the array [1,2,3,4] is complementary because for all indices i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5.
Return the minimum number of moves required to make nums complementary.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4

Explanation: In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,2,3] (underlined elements are changed).
nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.
nums[2] + nums[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.

Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports,"You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.
You are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.

ports​​i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
portsCount is the number of ports.
maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:

The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.
Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.
 
Example 1:

Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).

Example 2:

Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6

Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Ways to Make a Fair Array,"You are given an integer array nums. You can choose exactly one index (0-indexed) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.
For example, if nums = [6,1,7,4,1]:

Choosing to remove index 1 results in nums = [6,7,4,1].
Choosing to remove index 2 results in nums = [6,1,4,1].
Choosing to remove index 4 results in nums = [6,1,7,4].

An array is fair if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.
Return the number of indices that you could choose such that after the removal, nums is fair. 
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,6,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Remove index 0: [1,6,4] -> Even sum: 1 + 4 = 5. Odd sum: 6. Not fair.
Remove index 1: [2,6,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 6. Fair.
Remove index 2: [2,1,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.
Remove index 3: [2,1,6] -> Even sum: 2 + 6 = 8. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.
There is 1 index that you can remove to make nums fair.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can remove any index and the remaining array is fair.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value,"The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.
The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string ""abe"" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.
You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.
Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.

Maximize Grid Happiness,"You are given four integers, m, n, introvertsCount, and extrovertsCount. You have an m x n grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are introvertsCount introverts and extrovertsCount extroverts.
You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.
The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:

Introverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.
The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.
 
Example 1:


Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

Furthest Building You Can Reach,"You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.
You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.
While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.
 
Example 1:


Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.

Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities,"There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array edges of size n-1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge between cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.
A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.
For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to d.
Return an array of size n-1 where the dth element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d.
Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
Output: [3,4,0]
Explanation:
The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.
The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.

Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome,"You are given two strings a and b of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting a into two strings: aprefix and asuffix where a = aprefix + asuffix, and splitting b into two strings: bprefix and bsuffix where b = bprefix + bsuffix. Check if aprefix + bsuffix or bprefix + asuffix forms a palindrome.
When you split a string s into sprefix and ssuffix, either ssuffix or sprefix is allowed to be empty. For example, if s = ""abc"", then """" + ""abc"", ""a"" + ""bc"", ""ab"" + ""c"" , and ""abc"" + """" are valid splits.
Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return false.
Notice that x + y denotes the concatenation of strings x and y.
 
Example 1:

Input: a = ""x"", b = ""y""
Output: true
Explaination: If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
aprefix = """", asuffix = ""x""
bprefix = """", bsuffix = ""y""
Then, aprefix + bsuffix = """" + ""y"" = ""y"", which is a palindrome.

Example 2:

Even Odd Tree,"A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:

The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).

You are also given an integer radius where a tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to radius. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.
The signal quality of the ith tower at a coordinate (x, y) is calculated with the formula ⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋, where d is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.

Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests,"We have n buildings numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.
You are given an array requests where requests[i] = [fromi, toi] represents an employee's request to transfer from building fromi to building toi.
All buildings are full, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the net change in employee transfers is zero. This means the number of employees leaving is equal to the number of employees moving in. For example if n = 3 and two employees are leaving building 0, one is leaving building 1, and one is leaving building 2, there should be two employees moving to building 0, one employee moving to building 1, and one employee moving to building 2.
Return the maximum number of achievable requests.
 
Example 1:

Throne Inheritance,"A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.
The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.

Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder

For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.
Implement the ThroneInheritance class:

ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.
void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel,"You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.
You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.
You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.
Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.
 
Example 1:


Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.
The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.

Example 2:

Input: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.
2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.
3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.
4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.
5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.
6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.
7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.
The highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.

Example 3:

Input: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92
Output: -1
Explanation:
1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 * $1 - 1 * $92 = -$89.
2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.
3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.
4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$357.

Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests,"You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:

The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.

You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.
 
Example 1:


Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
Output: [1] 
Explanation: 
All of the servers start out available.
The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

Example 2:

Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
Output: [0]
Explanation: 
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

Example 3:

Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]

Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array edges where edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge of type typei between nodes ui and vi, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.
Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

Example 2:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]

Count All Possible Routes,"You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where locations[i] represents the position of city i. You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including start and finish).
Return the count of all possible routes from start to finish. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Example 2:

Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3

Example 3:

Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: It is impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.

Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted,"Given an integer array arr, remove a subarray (can be empty) from arr such that the remaining elements in arr are non-decreasing.
Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].

Example 2:

Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].

Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]

Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.
Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.
Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.
 
Example 1:


Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3

Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick,"Given a wooden stick of length n units. The stick is labelled from 0 to n. For example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:

Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.
You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.
The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.
Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:

The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).
Example 2:

Input: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]
Output: 22
Explanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.

Find the Winner of an Array Game,"Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.
A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.
Return the integer which will win the game.
It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1

Can Convert String in K Moves,"Given two strings s and t, your goal is to convert s into t in k moves or less.
During the ith (1 <= i <= k) move you can:

Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1 <= j <= s.length and j has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.
Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.
Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.
Return true if it's possible to convert s into t in no more than k moves, otherwise return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""input"", t = ""ouput"", k = 9

Explanation: In the 6th move, we shift 'i' 6 times to get 'o'. And in the 7th move we shift 'n' to get 'u'.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abc"", t = ""bcd"", k = 10
Output: false
Explanation: We need to shift each character in s one time to convert it into t. We can shift 'a' to 'b' during the 1st move. However, there is no way to shift the other characters in the remaining moves to obtain t from s.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""aab"", t = ""bbb"", k = 27

Return the minimum possible value of |func(arr, l, r) - target|.
Notice that func should be called with the values l and r where 0 <= l, r < arr.length.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [9,12,3,7,15], target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Calling func with all the pairs of [l,r] = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[0,3],[1,4],[0,4]], Winston got the following results [9,12,3,7,15,8,0,3,7,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The value closest to 5 is 7 and 3, thus the minimum difference is 2.

Example 2:

Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings,"Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions:

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.
Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""
Output: [""e"",""f"",""ccc""]
Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbaccd""
Output: [""d"",""bb"",""cc""]
Explanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [""d"",""abba"",""cc""] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d.

Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank,"We have a wooden plank of the length n units. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with a speed of 1 unit per second. Some of the ants move to the left, the other move to the right.
When two ants moving in two different directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.
When an ant reaches one end of the plank at a time t, it falls out of the plank immediately.
Given an integer n and two integer arrays left and right, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, return the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 4, left = [4,3], right = [0,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the image above:
-The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.
-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.
-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.
-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.
The last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it falls immediately out of the plank. (i.e., We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there are no ants on the plank).

Example 2:


Input: n = 7, left = [], right = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree,"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes ai and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

 
Constraints:

Avoid Flood in The City,"Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.
Given an integer array rains where:

rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array ans where:

ans.length == rains.length
ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.
Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.

Example 2:

Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.

The k Strongest Values in an Array,"Given an array of integers arr and an integer k.
A value arr[i] is said to be stronger than a value arr[j] if |arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m| where m is the median of the array.
If |arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|, then arr[i] is said to be stronger than arr[j] if arr[i] > arr[j].
Return a list of the strongest k values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position ((n - 1) / 2) in the sorted list (0-indexed).

For arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2. The median is 6.
For arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3], n = 4 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1. The median is 3.

 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls,"Given 2n balls of k distinct colors. You will be given an integer array balls of size k where balls[i] is the number of balls of color i.
All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first n balls to the first box and the remaining n balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).
Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
 
Example 1:

Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:

Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Example 3:

Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.

Queries on a Permutation With Key,"Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m, you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:

In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].

Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
 
Example 1:

Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
Output: [2,1,2,1] 
Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. 
Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].  

Example 2:

Input: queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4
Output: [3,1,2,0]

Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

Stone Game III,"Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.
 
Example 1:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

Example 2:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Example 3:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]
Output: ""Tie""
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid,"Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:

1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])

Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.
You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You will start at point (0, 0).
The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)

Rank Teams by Votes,"In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participating in the competition.
The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.
You are given an array of strings votes which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.
Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.
 
Example 1:

Input: votes = [""ABC"",""ACB"",""ABC"",""ACB"",""ACB""]
Output: ""ACB""
Explanation: 
Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place, so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and ranked third by 2 voters.
As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team, and team B is the third.

Example 2:

Input: votes = [""WXYZ"",""XYZW""]
Output: ""XWYZ""
Explanation:
X is the winner due to the tie-breaking rule. X has the same votes as W for the first position, but X has one vote in the second position, while W does not have any votes in the second position.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
 
Example 1:

Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [3,1,5] 
Explanation: 
The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest). 

Example 2:

Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [4,3,2,1,5]
Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.

Example 3:

Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3

Encrypt and Decrypt Strings,"You are given a character array keys containing unique characters and a string array values containing strings of length 2. You are also given another string array dictionary that contains all permitted original strings after decryption. You should implement a data structure that can encrypt or decrypt a 0-indexed string.
A string is encrypted with the following process:

For each character c in the string, we find the index i satisfying keys[i] == c in keys.
Replace c with values[i] in the string.

Note that in case a character of the string is not present in keys, the encryption process cannot be carried out, and an empty string """" is returned.
A string is decrypted with the following process:

For each substring s of length 2 occurring at an even index in the string, we find an i such that values[i] == s. If there are multiple valid i, we choose any one of them. This means a string could have multiple possible strings it can decrypt to.
Replace s with keys[i] in the string.

Implement the Encrypter class:

Encrypter(char[] keys, String[] values, String[] dictionary) Initializes the Encrypter class with keys, values, and dictionary.
String encrypt(String word1) Encrypts word1 with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string.
int decrypt(String word2) Returns the number of possible strings word2 could decrypt to that also appear in dictionary.

Output
[null, ""eizfeiam"", 2]

Explanation
Encrypter encrypter = new Encrypter([['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [""ei"", ""zf"", ""ei"", ""am""], [""abcd"", ""acbd"", ""adbc"", ""badc"", ""dacb"", ""cadb"", ""cbda"", ""abad""]);

                              // ""ei"" can map to 'a' or 'c', ""zf"" maps to 'b', and ""am"" maps to 'd'. 
                              // Thus, the possible strings after decryption are ""abad"", ""cbad"", ""abcd"", and ""cbcd"".

Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes,"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array brackets where brackets[i] = [upperi, percenti] means that the ith tax bracket has an upper bound of upperi and is taxed at a rate of percenti. The brackets are sorted by upper bound (i.e. upperi-1 < upperi for 0 < i < brackets.length).
Tax is calculated as follows:

The first upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent0.
The next upper1 - upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent1.
The next upper2 - upper1 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent2.
And so on.

You are given an integer income representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 
Example 1:

Input: brackets = [[3,50],[7,10],[12,25]], income = 10
Output: 2.65000
Explanation:
Based on your income, you have 3 dollars in the 1st tax bracket, 4 dollars in the 2nd tax bracket, and 3 dollars in the 3rd tax bracket.
The tax rate for the three tax brackets is 50%, 10%, and 25%, respectively.
In total, you pay $3 * 50% + $4 * 10% + $3 * 25% = $2.65 in taxes.

Example 2:

You are also given a 2D integer array prices, where prices[i] = [hi, wi, pricei] indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height hi and width wi for pricei dollars.
To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the entire height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to prices. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you cannot rotate a piece to swap its height and width.
Return the maximum money you can earn after cutting an m x n piece of wood.
Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.
 
Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 5, prices = [[1,4,2],[2,2,7],[2,1,3]]
Output: 19
Explanation: The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
- 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 * 7 = 14.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 * 3 = 3.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
This obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.
It can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

Example 2:


Input: m = 4, n = 6, prices = [[3,2,10],[1,4,2],[4,1,3]]
Output: 32
Explanation: The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
- 3 pieces of wood shaped 3 x 2, selling for a price of 3 * 10 = 30.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
This obtains a total of 30 + 2 = 32 money earned.
It can be shown that 32 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.
Notice that we cannot rotate the 1 x 4 piece of wood to obtain a 4 x 1 piece of wood.

Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation,"Given a callable function f(x, y) with a hidden formula and a value z, reverse engineer the formula and return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z. You may return the pairs in any order.
While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:

f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)

The function interface is defined like this:

interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for two positive integers x and y based on a formula.
  int f(int x, int y);
};

We will judge your solution as follows:

The judge has a list of 9 hidden implementations of CustomFunction, along with a way to generate an answer key of all valid pairs for a specific z.
The judge will receive two inputs: a function_id (to determine which implementation to test your code with), and the target z.
The judge will call your findSolution and compare your results with the answer key.
If your results match the answer key, your solution will be Accepted.

 
Example 1:

Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 1 is f(x, y) = x + y.
The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=4 -> f(1, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5.
x=2, y=3 -> f(2, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5.
x=3, y=2 -> f(3, 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.
x=4, y=1 -> f(4, 1) = 4 + 1 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 2 is f(x, y) = x * y.
The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=5 -> f(1, 5) = 1 * 5 = 5.
x=5, y=1 -> f(5, 1) = 5 * 1 = 5.

 
Constraints:

1 <= function_id <= 9

In one move, you can select any two adjacent characters of s and swap them.
Return the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome.
Note that the input will be generated such that s can always be converted to a palindrome.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""aabb""
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can obtain two palindromes from s, ""abba"" and ""baab"". 
- We can obtain ""abba"" from s in 2 moves: ""aabb"" -> ""abab"" -> ""abba"".
- We can obtain ""baab"" from s in 2 moves: ""aabb"" -> ""abab"" -> ""baab"".
Thus, the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome is 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""letelt""

Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].

Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams,"You are given a 0-indexed string array words, where words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and words[i] are anagrams, and delete words[i] from words. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.
Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, ""dacb"" is an anagram of ""abdc"".
 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""abba"",""baba"",""bbaa"",""cd"",""cd""]
Output: [""abba"",""cd""]
Explanation:
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words[2] = ""bbaa"" and words[1] = ""baba"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""baba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[1] = ""baba"" and words[0] = ""abba"" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[2] = ""cd"" and words[1] = ""cd"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd""].
We can no longer perform any operations, so [""abba"",""cd""] is the final answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""]
Output: [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""]
Explanation:
No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.

Maximize the Topmost Element After K Moves,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums representing the contents of a pile, where nums[0] is the topmost element of the pile.
In one move, you can perform either of the following:

If the pile is not empty, remove the topmost element of the pile.
If there are one or more removed elements, add any one of them back onto the pile. This element becomes the new topmost element.

You are also given an integer k, which denotes the total number of moves to be made.
Return the maximum value of the topmost element of the pile possible after exactly k moves. In case it is not possible to obtain a non-empty pile after k moves, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,2,4,0,6], k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
One of the ways we can end with 5 at the top of the pile after 4 moves is as follows:
- Step 1: Remove the topmost element = 5. The pile becomes [2,2,4,0,6].
- Step 2: Remove the topmost element = 2. The pile becomes [2,4,0,6].
- Step 3: Remove the topmost element = 2. The pile becomes [4,0,6].
- Step 4: Add 5 back onto the pile. The pile becomes [5,4,0,6].

The Dining Philosophers,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.
Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.
Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org
 
The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:

philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.

 
We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Design Skiplist,"Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.
A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.
For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
Implement the Skiplist class:

Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.
bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.
bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.
 
Example 1:

Input
[""Skiplist"", ""add"", ""add"", ""add"", ""search"", ""add"", ""search"", ""erase"", ""erase"", ""search""]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]

Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings,"You are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.
More formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.
Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.
A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""ababbb""
Output: 9
Explanation: Substrings ""aba"" and ""bbb"" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""zaaaxbbby""
Output: 9
Explanation: Substrings ""aaa"" and ""bbb"" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.

Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array candies. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size candies[i]. You can divide each pile into any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles together.
You are also given an integer k. You should allocate piles of candies to k children such that each child gets the same number of candies. Each child can take at most one pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.
Return the maximum number of candies each child can get.
 
Example 1:

Input: candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.

Example 2:

Input: candies = [2,5], k = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.

The sum of the integers is num.

Return the minimum possible size of such a set, or -1 if no such set exists.
Note:

The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered 0.
The units digit of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.

 
Example 1:

Sort the Jumbled Numbers,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array mapping which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. mapping[i] = j means digit i should be mapped to digit j in this system.
The mapped value of an integer is the new integer obtained by replacing each occurrence of digit i in the integer with mapping[i] for all 0 <= i <= 9.
You are also given another integer array nums. Return the array nums sorted in non-decreasing order based on the mapped values of its elements.
Notes:

Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the same relative order as in the input.
The elements of nums should only be sorted based on their mapped values and not be replaced by them.

 
Example 1:

Input: mapping = [8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6], nums = [991,338,38]
Output: [338,38,991]
Explanation: 
Map the number 991 as follows:
1. mapping[9] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.
2. mapping[1] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.
338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.
Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.
Thus, the sorted array is [338,38,991].

Example 2:

Input: mapping = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], nums = [789,456,123]
Output: [123,456,789]
Explanation: 789 maps to 789, 456 maps to 456, and 123 maps to 123. Thus, the sorted array is [123,456,789].

Get Equal Substrings Within Budget,"You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.
You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).
Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""bcdf"", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: ""abc"" of s can change to ""bcd"".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""cdef"", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""acde"", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.

(r1i, c1i) is the coordinate of the top-left cell of the ith artifact and
(r2i, c2i) is the coordinate of the bottom-right cell of the ith artifact.

You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.
Given a 0-indexed 2D integer array dig where dig[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that you will excavate the cell (ri, ci), return the number of artifacts that you can extract.

Explanation: 
The different colors represent different artifacts. Excavated cells are labeled with a 'D' in the grid.
There is 1 artifact that can be extracted, namely the red artifact.
The blue artifact has one part in cell (1,1) which remains uncovered, so we cannot extract it.

Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character,"Let the function f(s) be the frequency of the lexicographically smallest character in a non-empty string s. For example, if s = ""dcce"" then f(s) = 2 because the lexicographically smallest character is 'c', which has a frequency of 2.
You are given an array of strings words and another array of query strings queries. For each query queries[i], count the number of words in words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W) for each W in words.
Return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:

Input: queries = [""cbd""], words = [""zaaaz""]

The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:

The rank is an integer starting from 1.
If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
	
If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
If p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in b. For example, ""abcc"" is lexicographically smaller than ""abcd"" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and 'c' is smaller than 'd'.
 
Example 1:

Input: palindrome = ""abccba""
Output: ""aaccba""
Explanation: There are many ways to make ""abccba"" not a palindrome, such as ""zbccba"", ""aaccba"", and ""abacba"".
Of all the ways, ""aaccba"" is the lexicographically smallest.

Binary Tree Coloring Game,"Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree. We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree. n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.
Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x. The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.
Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.
You are the second player. If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true. If it is not possible, return false.

Minimum Falling Path Sum II,"Given an n x n integer matrix grid, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.
A falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of grid such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,5,9], [1,5,7], [1,6,7], [1,6,8],
[2,4,8], [2,4,9], [2,6,7], [2,6,8],
[3,4,8], [3,4,9], [3,5,7], [3,5,9]
The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,5,7], so the answer is 13.

Graph Connectivity With Threshold,"We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:

x % z == 0,
y % z == 0, and
z > threshold.

Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).
Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
Output: [false,false,true]
Explanation: The divisors for each number:
1:   1
2:   1, 2
3:   1, 3
4:   1, 2, 4
5:   1, 5
6:   1, 2, 3, 6
Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the
only ones directly connected. The result of each query:
[1,4]   1 is not connected to 4
[2,5]   2 is not connected to 5
[3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6

Example 2:


Input: n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]
Output: [true,true,true,true,true]
Explanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,
all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.

Example 3:


Input: n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: [false,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.
Please notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].

When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.

Formally, the three rules for our grammar:

For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.
For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...
For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) × R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.
 
Example 1:

Input: expression = ""{a,b}{c,{d,e}}""
Output: [""ac"",""ad"",""ae"",""bc"",""bd"",""be""]

Example 2:

Input: expression = ""{{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}}""

Building H2O,"There are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.
There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.
In other words:

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.
Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

Find in Mountain Array,"(This problem is an interactive problem.)
You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
	
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]



Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.
You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:

MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
 
Example 1:

Input: array = [1,2,3,4,5,3,1], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 exists in the array, at index=2 and index=5. Return the minimum index, which is 2.
Example 2:

Input: array = [0,1,2,4,2,1], target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: 3 does not exist in the array, so we return -1.

Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.
The mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.
Since the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.
The mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.

Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.

 
Constraints:

count.length == 256
0 <= count[i] <= 109
1 <= sum(count) <= 109
The mode of the sample that count represents is unique.

Explanation: 
For example, in ""abbaca"" we could remove ""bb"" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is ""aaca"", of which only ""aa"" is possible, so the final string is ""ca"".

Last Stone Weight,"You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]

Moving Stones Until Consecutive II,"There are some stones in different positions on the X-axis. You are given an integer array stones, the positions of the stones.
Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position. In one move, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).
Return an integer array answer of length 2 where:

answer[0] is the minimum number of moves you can play, and
answer[1] is the maximum number of moves you can play.

Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal,"We run a preorder depth-first search (DFS) on the root of a binary tree.
At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D + 1.  The depth of the root node is 0.
If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
Given the output traversal of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
 
Example 1:


Input: traversal = ""1-2--3--4-5--6--7""

Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String,"You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.
We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.

For example, if s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""parker"", s2 = ""morris"", baseStr = ""parser""

Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is ""makkek"".

Example 2:

Input: s1 = ""hello"", s2 = ""world"", baseStr = ""hold""

Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is ""hdld"".

Example 3:

Input: s1 = ""leetcode"", s2 = ""programs"", baseStr = ""sourcecode""
Output: ""aauaaaaada""
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is ""aauaaaaada"".

A binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of Node.left has a value strictly less than Node.val, and any descendant of Node.right has a value strictly greater than Node.val.
A preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses Node.left, then traverses Node.right.
 
Example 1:


Input: preorder = [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

Example 2:

Input: preorder = [1,3]
Output: [1,null,3]

 
Constraints:

1 <= preorder.length <= 100
1 <= preorder[i] <= 1000

Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row,"In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
 
Example 1:


Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.

Example 2:

Input: tops = [3,5,1,2,3], bottoms = [3,6,3,3,4]

Clumsy Factorial,"The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order.

For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.

However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.
Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11.
Given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.

Grid Illumination,"There is a 2D grid of size n x n where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially turned off.
You are given a 2D array of lamp positions lamps, where lamps[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the lamp at grid[rowi][coli] is turned on. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.
When a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.
You are also given another 2D array queries, where queries[j] = [rowj, colj]. For the jth query, determine whether grid[rowj][colj] is illuminated or not. After answering the jth query, turn off the lamp at grid[rowj][colj] and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with grid[rowj][colj].
Return an array of integers ans, where ans[j] should be 1 if the cell in the jth query was illuminated, or 0 if the lamp was not.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].
The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.

Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:

During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).
Return the number of good starting indices.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some

Example 1:


Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.

Pancake Sorting,"Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.
In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.
Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.

Vowel Spellchecker,"Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.
For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

	
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""yellow""


Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
	
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yllw"": correct = """" (no match)



In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:

When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some queries, return a list of words answer, where answer[i] is the correct word for query = queries[i].
 
Example 1:
Input: wordlist = [""KiTe"",""kite"",""hare"",""Hare""], queries = [""kite"",""Kite"",""KiTe"",""Hare"",""HARE"",""Hear"",""hear"",""keti"",""keet"",""keto""]
Output: [""kite"",""KiTe"",""KiTe"",""Hare"",""hare"","""","""",""KiTe"","""",""KiTe""]

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.
There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). For example, ""x - x"" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but ""-x + x"" is not because it uses negation.

Input: tokens = [200,100], power = 150
Output: 1
Explanation: Play token1 (100) face-up, reducing your power to 50 and increasing your score to 1.
There is no need to play token0, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is 1.

Example 3:

Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200
Output: 2
Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:

Play token0 (100) face-up, reducing power to 100 and increasing score to 1.
Play token3 (400) face-down, increasing power to 500 and reducing score to 0.
Play token1 (200) face-up, reducing power to 300 and increasing score to 1.
Play token2 (300) face-up, reducing power to 0 and increasing score to 2.

The maximum score achievable is 2.

Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column,"On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.
A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
 
Example 1:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Example 2:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Example 3:

Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: [0,0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.

bce
cae

You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.
Return the number of columns that you will delete.
 
Example 1:

Input: strs = [""cba"",""daf"",""ghi""]
Output: 1
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf

Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""a"",""b""]
Output: 0
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:

Minimize Malware Spread,"You are given a network of n nodes represented as an n x n adjacency matrix graph, where the ith node is directly connected to the jth node if graph[i][j] == 1.
Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected, and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.
Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops. We will remove exactly one node from initial.
Return the node that, if removed, would minimize M(initial). If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.

Online Stock Span,"Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.

RLE Iterator,"We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.

For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.
 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""abc"",""deq"",""mee"",""aqq"",""dkd"",""ccc""], pattern = ""abb""

For some 1 <= k <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first k letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.
Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it is impossible, return -1.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [""@.a.."",""###.#"",""b.A.B""]

Example 1:

Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:

The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.

All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).
Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.
 
Example 1:

Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0.

an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.

There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).
For each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence,"You are given a string of digits num, such as ""123456579"". We can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].
Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that:

0 <= f[i] < 231, (that is, each integer fits in a 32-bit signed integer type),
f.length >= 3, and
f[i] + f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] for all 0 <= i < f.length - 2.

Note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

Find And Replace in String,"You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.
To complete the ith replacement operation:

Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s.
If it does not occur, do nothing.
Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i].

For example, if s = ""abcd"", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = ""ab"", and targets[i] = ""eee"", then the result of this replacement will be ""eeecd"".
All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.

For example, a testcase with s = ""abc"", indices = [0, 1], and sources = [""ab"",""bc""] will not be generated because the ""ab"" and ""bc"" replacements overlap.

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called ""Ring Buffer"".
One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Masking Personal Information,"You are given a personal information string s, representing either an email address or a phone number. Return the masked personal information using the below rules.
Email address:
An email address is:

A name consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, followed by
The '@' symbol, followed by
The domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters with a dot '.' somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).

To mask an email:

The uppercase letters in the name and domain must be converted to lowercase letters.
The middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks ""*****"".

Phone number:
A phone number is formatted as follows:

The phone number contains 10-13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number.
The remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.
Separation characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '} separate the above digits in some way.

To mask a phone number:

Remove all separation characters.
The masked phone number should have the form:

Goat Latin,"You are given a string sentence that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.
We would like to convert the sentence to ""Goat Latin"" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

If a word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append ""ma"" to the end of the word.

	
For example, the word ""apple"" becomes ""applema"".


If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add ""ma"".
	
For example, the word ""goat"" becomes ""oatgma"".


Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.

Initially, each card is placed on a table such that the front number is facing up and the other is facing down. You may flip over any number of cards (possibly zero).
After flipping the cards, an integer is considered good if it is facing down on some card and not facing up on any card.
Return the minimum possible good integer after flipping the cards. If there are no good integers, return 0.
 
Example 1:

The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j), where abs is the absolute value function.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""loveleetcode"", c = ""e""
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

Design Linked List,"Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.
Implement the MyLinkedList class:

MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.

For example, starting with ""hello"", we could do an extension on the group ""o"" to get ""hellooo"", but we cannot get ""helloo"" since the group ""oo"" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like ""ll"" -> ""lllll"" to get ""helllllooo"".

Number of Lines To Write String,"You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', and so on.
You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.
Return an array result of length 2 where:

result[0] is the total number of lines.
result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.

Bricks Falling When Hit,"You are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:

It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.

You are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).
Return an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.
Note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.
 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]], hits = [[1,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0]]
The two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall. The resulting grid is:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0]]
Hence the result is [2].

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [0,0]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
All remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0]]
Once again, all remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall.
Hence the result is [0,0].

Champagne Tower,"We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.
Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)
For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Output: 0.00000
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.

For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

Is Graph Bipartite?,"There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].

The format of the output is as follows:

For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
	
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".


Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
	
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.


The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
	
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].

Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees,"A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.
Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.
Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.


class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
 
Example 1:
 

Input: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.
If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.
Notice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.


Example 2:

Input: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]
Output: [[1,0]]

You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List,"You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.
Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.
Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.

         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]

Contain Virus,"A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.
The world is modeled as an m x n binary grid isInfected, where isInfected[i][j] == 0 represents uninfected cells, and isInfected[i][j] == 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.
Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region (i.e., the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night). There will never be a tie.
Return the number of walls used to quarantine all the infected regions. If the world will become fully infected, return the number of walls used.
 
Example 1:


Input: isInfected = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 2 contaminated regions.
On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:

On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.


Example 2:


Input: isInfected = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.

Example 3:

Input: isInfected = [[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.

 
Constraints:

Shortest Completing Word,"Given a string licensePlate and an array of strings words, find the shortest completing word in words.
A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in licensePlate. Ignore numbers and spaces in licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.
For example, if licensePlate = ""aBc 12c"", then it contains letters 'a', 'b' (ignoring case), and 'c' twice. Possible completing words are ""abccdef"", ""caaacab"", and ""cbca"".
Return the shortest completing word in words. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in words.
 
Example 1:

Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 PSt"", words = [""step"",""steps"",""stripe"",""stepple""]
Output: ""steps""
Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.
""step"" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.
""steps"" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.
""stripe"" is missing an 's'.
""stepple"" is missing an 's'.
Since ""steps"" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.

Example 2:

Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 456"", words = [""looks"",""pest"",""stew"",""show""]
Output: ""pest""
Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these ""pest"", ""stew"", and ""show"" are shortest. The answer is ""pest"" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.

Parse Lisp Expression,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.
The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

 
Example 1:

Input: expression = ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))""
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Example 2:

Input: expression = ""(let x 3 x 2 x)""
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Example 3:

Input: expression = ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))""
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

To perform a flood fill:

Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.

Number of Atoms,"Given a string formula representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom.
The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.
One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow.

For example, ""H2O"" and ""H2O2"" are possible, but ""H1O2"" is impossible.

Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.

For example, ""H2O2He3Mg4"" is also a formula.

A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.

For example, ""(H2O2)"" and ""(H2O2)3"" are formulas.

Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.
The test cases are generated so that all the values in the output fit in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:

Input: formula = ""H2O""
Output: ""H2O""
Explanation: The count of elements are {'H': 2, 'O': 1}.

Example 2:

Input: formula = ""Mg(OH)2""

Split Linked List in Parts,"Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.
The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.
The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.
Return an array of the k parts.
 
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 5
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
Explanation:
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].

Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3

Find Pivot Index,"Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,-1]

Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.

For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.

For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
 
Example 1:

Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Example 2:

Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

 
Constraints:

1 <= source.length <= 100

Accounts Merge,"Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[""John"",""johnsmith@mail.com"",""john_newyork@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnsmith@mail.com"",""john00@mail.com""],[""Mary"",""mary@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnnybravo@mail.com""]]
Output: [[""John"",""john00@mail.com"",""john_newyork@mail.com"",""johnsmith@mail.com""],[""Mary"",""mary@mail.com""],[""John"",""johnnybravo@mail.com""]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email ""johnsmith@mail.com"".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.
Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

Example 2:

Input: s1 = ""delete"", s2 = ""leet""

Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.

Stickers to Spell Word,"We are given n different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
You would like to spell out the given string target by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
Return the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out target. If the task is impossible, return -1.
Note: In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.
 
Example 1:

Input: stickers = [""with"",""example"",""science""], target = ""thehat""
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can use 2 ""with"" stickers, and 1 ""example"" sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target ""thehat"".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.
Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0

Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences,"You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:

Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.

Return true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).

Decode Ways II,"A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> ""1""

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".
In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message ""1*"" may represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".

Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".

Example 3:

Input: s = ""2*""
Output: 15
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".
""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.

Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= logs.length <= 500
0 <= function_id < n
0 <= timestamp <= 109
No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.

Add One Row to Tree,"Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.
Note that the root node is at depth 1.
The adding rule is:

Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur's left subtree root and right subtree root.
cur's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
cur's original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
If depth == 1 that means there is no depth depth - 1 at all, then create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.

Construct String from Binary Tree,"Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:


Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.


Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:

If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.



Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.
In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.


 
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: ""1(2(4))(3)""
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be ""1(2(4)())(3()())"", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be ""1(2(4))(3)"".

Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: ""1(2()(4))(3)""
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.

Tag Validator,"Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.
A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

 
Example 1:

Input: code = ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Example 2:

Input: code = ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.

Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders,"Table: Orders

+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

 
Write a solution to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.
The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |

| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.

 
Follow up: What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

Investments in 2016,"Table: Insurance

| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |
+-------------+-------+
pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.

 
Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).

Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
Insurance table:
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |

| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
Output: 
+----------+
| tiv_2016 |
+----------+
| 45.00    |
+----------+
Explanation: 
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.

Note: your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.

Explanation: 1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in ""1000/((100/10)/2)"" are redundant since they do not influence the operation priority.
So you should return ""1000/(100/10/2)"".

If the character key[i] has been aligned at the ""12:00"" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

 
Example 1:


Input: ring = ""godding"", key = ""gd""
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring ""godding"" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become ""ddinggo"".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.

Example 2:

Input: ring = ""godding"", key = ""godding""
Output: 13

 
Constraints:

1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100
ring and key consist of only lower case English letters.

Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.
You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.
Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.
Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
 
Example 1:

Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]

Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.

Sliding Window Median,"The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For examples, if arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For examples, if arr = [1,2,3,4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. There is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

LFU Cache,"Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
Implement the LFUCache class:

LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.
When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

Poor Pigs,"There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.
You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

Choose some live pigs to feed.
For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.
 
Example 1:

Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15

Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

Example 2:

Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.

- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.

Circular Array Loop,"You are playing a game involving a circular array of non-zero integers nums. Each nums[i] denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index i:

If nums[i] is positive, move nums[i] steps forward, and
If nums[i] is negative, move nums[i] steps backward.

Since the array is circular, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.
A cycle in the array consists of a sequence of indices seq of length k where:

Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...

Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons,"There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Pacific Atlantic Water Flow,"There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.
The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).
The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.
Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 
Example 1:


Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean

Longest Absolute File Path,"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.
In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):

dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.
 
Example 1:


Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is ""dir/subdir2/file.ext"" of length 20.

Example 2:


Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext""
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
""dir/subdir1/file1.ext"" of length 21
""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.

Pour water from one jug into another until the receiving jug is full, or the transferring jug is empty.

 
Example 1: 

Input:   x = 3, y = 5, target = 4 
Output:   true 
Explanation:
Follow these steps to reach a total of 4 liters:

Fill the 5-liter jug (0, 5).
Pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, leaving 2 liters (3, 2).
Empty the 3-liter jug (0, 2).
Transfer the 2 liters from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug (2, 0).
Fill the 5-liter jug again (2, 5).
Pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full. This leaves 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (3, 4).
Empty the 3-liter jug. Now, you have exactly 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (0, 4).

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
 
Example 1:


Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Example 2:


Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

 
Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.

 
Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

Peeking Iterator,"Design an iterator that supports the peek operation on an existing iterator in addition to the hasNext and the next operations.
Implement the PeekingIterator class:

PeekingIterator(Iterator<int> nums) Initializes the object with the given integer iterator iterator.
int next() Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still elements in the array.
int peek() Returns the next element in the array without moving the pointer.

Note: Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and Iterator, but they all support the int next() and boolean hasNext() functions.
 
Example 1:

Input
[""PeekingIterator"", ""next"", ""peek"", ""next"", ""next"", ""hasNext""]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false]

Explanation
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator([1, 2, 3]); // [1,2,3]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move [1,2,3].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.

Dungeon Game,"The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.
The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).
To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

Binary Search Tree Iterator,"Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):

BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.
You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Example 2:


Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:


Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA < m
0 <= skipB < n
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.

Clone Graph,"Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

 
Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 
Example 1:


Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

Example 2:


Input: adjList = [[]]

Interleaving String,"Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.
An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...

Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
 
Example 1:


Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbcbcac""
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = ""aa"" + ""bc"" + ""c"", and s2 into s2 = ""dbbc"" + ""a"".
Interleaving the two splits, we get ""aa"" + ""dbbc"" + ""bc"" + ""a"" + ""c"" = ""aadbbcbcac"".

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes (""2"" and ""5"" vs ""25"").
For example, ""11106"" can be decoded into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because ""06"" is not a valid code (only ""6"" is valid).

Scramble String,"We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.



Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".
""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

Simplify Path,"You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.
The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

A single period '.' represents the current directory.
A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

The path must start with a single slash '/'.
Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the simplified canonical path.
 
Example 1:

Text Justification,"Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string ""3322251"" we replace ""33"" with ""23"", replace ""222"" with ""32"", replace ""5"" with ""15"" and replace ""1"" with ""11"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""23321511"".

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Roman to Integer,"Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""III""
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""LVIII""
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""MCMXCIV""
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

1


V

X

L

C
100


D
500


M

Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = 3749
Output: ""MMMDCCXLIX""
Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places

String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace ("" "").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""42""
