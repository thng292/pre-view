Candidates from traditionally underrepresented groups in tech are highly encouraged to apply.\\nAt 15 people, our team is lean, and our developers are top notch. As a frontend developer at Type/Code, you won’t just be churning out code at breakneck speed, blindly following a spec, disconnected from your work. You’ll care about the products you build and the community you build it with. You’ll exercise autonomy and decision-making alongside team collaboration and mentorship to do amazing work. We hold ourselves to a high level of visual finesse and are always exploring novel approaches to layouts and interactivity.\\nOur bespoke interface designs are very non-traditional/non-uniform and require both creativity and a thorough understanding of visual design fundamentals for implementing refined typography, complex layouts, and elevating static designs and prototypes with thoughtful interaction details, transitions, and animations — coupled with a thorough understanding of UX fundamentals to ensure functional and behavioral usability.\\nEvery dev on our team came on board with different strengths and we’re not too prescriptive about your current specific expertise. At Type/Code you’ll be expected to constantly learn and grow on the job, taking on interesting tasks outside your normal wheelhouse and expanding your toolkit. That said, this is a mid to senior role and significant experience (3-5+ years) as an frontend developer is a must. While familiarity with modern javascript frameworks (and related tools) is required, our biggest need right now is for a real styling genius. Extensive (and demonstrable) experience with thoughtfully implemented Sass/CSS is a must - send us samples!\\nWhat We Value:Community: our team is small and close knit and we want you to join the familyWork/life balance: we\\'re not a startup, we tend to stay away from projects with difficult deadlines (not to say it doesn\\'t happen), and we want you to be happy so you should make your non-work life a priority!Thoughtful, high quality work: we want you to own what you do, care about it, want to do it well, and create something you feel good aboutCommunication: especially in the current distributed model, frequent and clear communication with the team is crucial\\nAs a mid to senior level position, experience with all of the below is preferred and expertise in some is assumed. As such, in your cover letter/email we’d love to hear about your experience with the following:\\nIn order of importance(1) Frontend styling: we strongly favor greenfield/project-specific Sass rather than using a CSS framework and always emphasize responsive implementations. As mentioned above, our bespoke layouts and designs are very non-traditional/non-uniform and require both creativity and a thorough understanding of complex styling.\\n(2) Frontend javascript development: we\\'re primarily a Vue.js shop, though we do have some React projects (and this may increase in the near future), with an equal emphasis on presentation and actual application logic. Our complex frontend applications require thorough knowledge of vanilla JS and the DOM.\\n(3) Backend integration: we work with both REST and GraphQL APIs\\n(4) Development lifecycle: we\\'re not super rigid here, but we follow a formal dev/stage/deploy process with extensive code review and QA, TDD when it makes sense, and as agile as makes sense for a particular project’s requirements\\n(5) Version control: GitHub and increasingly all the fancy GitHub features (issues, discussions, actions, secrets, etc)\\nThough our team is currently pretty distributed we\\'ve recently opened a Brooklyn office and local employees are encouraged to come in a couple times a week (though not explicitly required) — our only location requirement is that you have sufficient work hours overlap with the rest of the team.\\nCompensation & Benefits:Competitive salaryUp to 100% coverage on health, dental, and vision insurance401k MatchingGenerous vacation policy; unlimited sick daysUp to 15 holidays including the entire week from Dec 24th to after the New YearProfessional growth stipendFairly location agnosticFlexible hours\\n-----------------------------------\\nYour task is to extract the following information from the above paragraph and export it to valid json:\\n- Company name\\n- Job title\\n- Job level (intern, fresher, junior, senior)\\n- Year of experiences (yoe)\\n- Programming languages\\n- Frameworks\\n- Skills (technical skill only)\\n- Responisbilities\\n- Problem tag\\n- Problem difficulty\\n- Interview topics\\n\\nProblem tag is the kind of problems the interviewer should ask the candidate, based on the job title, job level and experiences.
