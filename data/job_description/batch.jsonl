Candidates from traditionally underrepresented groups in tech are highly encouraged to apply.\nAt 15 people, our team is lean, and our developers are top notch. As a frontend developer at Type/Code, you won\u2019t just be churning out code at breakneck speed, blindly following a spec, disconnected from your work. You\u2019ll care about the products you build and the community you build it with. You\u2019ll exercise autonomy and decision-making alongside team collaboration and mentorship to do amazing work. We hold ourselves to a high level of visual finesse and are always exploring novel approaches to layouts and interactivity.\nOur bespoke interface designs are very non-traditional/non-uniform and require both creativity and a thorough understanding of visual design fundamentals for implementing refined typography, complex layouts, and elevating static designs and prototypes with thoughtful interaction details, transitions, and animations \u2014 coupled with a thorough understanding of UX fundamentals to ensure functional and behavioral usability.\nEvery dev on our team came on board with different strengths and we\u2019re not too prescriptive about your current specific expertise. At Type/Code you\u2019ll be expected to constantly learn and grow on the job, taking on interesting tasks outside your normal wheelhouse and expanding your toolkit. That said, this is a mid to senior role and significant experience (3-5+ years) as an frontend developer is a must. While familiarity with modern javascript frameworks (and related tools) is required, our biggest need right now is for a real styling genius. Extensive (and demonstrable) experience with thoughtfully implemented Sass/CSS is a must - send us samples!\nWhat We Value:Community: our team is small and close knit and we want you to join the familyWork/life balance: we're not a startup, we tend to stay away from projects with difficult deadlines (not to say it doesn't happen), and we want you to be happy so you should make your non-work life a priority!Thoughtful, high quality work: we want you to own what you do, care about it, want to do it well, and create something you feel good aboutCommunication: especially in the current distributed model, frequent and clear communication with the team is crucial\nAs a mid to senior level position, experience with all of the below is preferred and expertise in some is assumed. As such, in your cover letter/email we\u2019d love to hear about your experience with the following:\nIn order of importance(1) Frontend styling: we strongly favor greenfield/project-specific Sass rather than using a CSS framework and always emphasize responsive implementations. As mentioned above, our bespoke layouts and designs are very non-traditional/non-uniform and require both creativity and a thorough understanding of complex styling.\n(2) Frontend javascript development: we're primarily a Vue.js shop, though we do have some React projects (and this may increase in the near future), with an equal emphasis on presentation and actual application logic. Our complex frontend applications require thorough knowledge of vanilla JS and the DOM.\n(3) Backend integration: we work with both REST and GraphQL APIs\n(4) Development lifecycle: we're not super rigid here, but we follow a formal dev/stage/deploy process with extensive code review and QA, TDD when it makes sense, and as agile as makes sense for a particular project\u2019s requirements\n(5) Version control: GitHub and increasingly all the fancy GitHub features (issues, discussions, actions, secrets, etc)\nThough our team is currently pretty distributed we've recently opened a Brooklyn office and local employees are encouraged to come in a couple times a week (though not explicitly required) \u2014 our only location requirement is that you have sufficient work hours overlap with the rest of the team.\nCompensation & Benefits:Competitive salaryUp to 100% coverage on health, dental, and vision insurance401k MatchingGenerous vacation policy; unlimited sick daysUp to 15 holidays including the entire week from Dec 24th to after the New YearProfessional growth stipendFairly location agnosticFlexible hours\n-----------------------------------\nYour task is to extract the following information from the above paragraph and export it to valid json:\n- Company name\n- Job title\n- Job level (intern, fresher, junior, senior)\n- Year of experiences (yoe)\n- Programming languages\n- Frameworks\n- Skills (technical skill only)\n- Responisbilities\n- Problem tag\n- Problem difficulty\n- Interview topics\n\nProblem tag is the kind of problems the interviewer should ask the candidate, based on the job title, job level and experiences.

Needs deep enough understanding of ISO protocol development to break it down to bitmaps, data elements, data fields, etc.\u00b7 Does not need to know anything off the top of their head or recreate on the fly, but candidates have been lacking even conceptually.\u00b7 Asking about authorization requests and need to know the structure. How would you approach development from the protocol perspective?\u00b7 Integer reading: Java and big vs. little endian byte orders Can you explain the basic structure of an ISO 8583 message?An ISO 8583 message consists of a fixed-length header, a variable-length message body, and a fixed-length trailer. The message body contains fields that carry information about the transaction, such as the type of transaction, account details, and transaction amounts. Each field is identified by a numeric field number. What are the primary components of an ISO 8583 message field, and how are they defined?An ISO 8583 message field consists of the field number, data type, and maximum length. The field number uniquely identifies the field's purpose, the data type specifies the format of the data (e.g., numeric or alphanumeric), and the maximum length defines the field's capacity. Explain the significance of the MTI (Message Type Indicator) in an ISO 8583 message.The MTI is a four-digit numeric code that specifies the type and purpose of the message. It determines the overall format and the meaning of the fields within the message. The MTI is essential for routing the message to the correct processing entity. How is binary encoding used in ISO 8583 messages, and when is it preferable over ASCII encoding?Binary encoding is used in ISO 8583 messages to represent data more efficiently, particularly for numeric fields. It's preferable over ASCII encoding when data size and transmission speed are critical, such as in high-speed financial networks. Binary encoding is more compact and faster to process.  Java Developer:Has a well-developed prototype that takes data from Excel (ingested from transaction applications), analyzes the data and pushes out the corresponding transaction message. Has an injector function (injection of transactional data) and responded, but both are not complete and need to be build out.1. Needs a hands-on developer, Senior individual contributor who has taken applications to production2. Intake of ISO messages through the systems, converted data format and ingests data to Excel. Java product on top of that converts into message outputs. C++/XML for file exchange3. Using Java/Spring Boot for all services4. REST APIs5. ISO8583 protocol needed for transactional data6. Unit testing required (Java code, Junit or similar)7. UI us a plus but not required8. Nice to have HP Nonstop background9.
